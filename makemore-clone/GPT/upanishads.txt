Invocation 


Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 
us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 
Truth! May we cherish no ill feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Katha Upanishad 


Part One 
Chapter I 
1 


Vayjasravasa, desiring rewards, performed the Visvajit sacrifice, 
in which he gave away all his property. He had a son named 
Nachiketa. 


2—3 


When the gifts were being distributed, faith entered into the 
heart of Nachiketa, who was still a boy. He said to himself: 
Joyless, surely, are the worlds to which he goes who gives 
away cows no longer able to drink, to eat, to give milk, or to 
calve. 


4 


He said to his father: Father! To whom will you give me? He 
said this a second and a third time. Then his father replied: 
Unto death I will give you. 


5 


Among many I am the first; or among many I am the 
middlemost. But certainly I am never the last. What purpose of 
the King of Death will my father serve today by thus giving me 
away to him? 


6 
Nachiketa said: Look back and see how it was with those who 
came before us and observe how it is with those who are now 


with us. A mortal ripens like corn and like corn he springs up 
again. 





7 


Verily, like fire a brahmin guest enters a house; the 
householder pacifies him by giving him water and a seat. Bring 
him water. O King of Death! 


8 


The brahmin who dwells in a house, fasting, destroys that 
foolish householder's hopes and expectations, the reward of his 
intercourse with pious people, the merit of his kindly speech, 
the good results of his sacrifices and beneficial deeds and his 
cattle and children as well. 


9 


Yama said: O Brahmin, salutations to you! You are a venerable 
guest and have dwelt in my house three nights without eating; 
therefore choose now three boons, one for each night, O 
Brahmin! May all be well with me! 


10 


Nachiketa said: O Death, may Gautama, my father, be calm, 
cheerful and free from anger toward me! May he recognise me 
and greet me when I shall have been sent home by you! This I 
choose as the first of the three boons. 


11 


Yama said: Through my favour, your father, Auddilaki Aruni, 
will recognise you and be again toward you as he was before. 
After having seen you freed from the jaws of death, he will 
sleep peacefully at night and bear no anger against you. 


12—13 


Nachiketa said: In the Heavenly World there is no fear 
whatsoever. You, O Death, are not there and no one is afraid of 
old age. Leaving behind both hunger and thirst and out of the 
reach of sorrow, all rejoice in Heaven. 

You know, O Death, the Fire—sacrifice, which leads to 
Heaven. Explain it to me, for I am full of faith. The inhabitants 
of Heaven attain immortality. This I ask as my second boon. 


14 


Yama said: I know well the Fire—sacrifice, which leads to 
Heaven and I will explain it to you. Listen to me. Know this 





Fire to be the means of attaining Heaven. It is the support of the 
universe; it is hidden in the hearts of the wise. 


15 


Yama then told him about the Fire, which is the source of the 
worlds and what bricks were to be gathered for the altar and 
how many and how the sacrificial fire was to be lighted. 
Nachiketa, too, repeated all this as it had been told him. Then 
Yama, being pleased with him, spoke again. 


16 


High—souled Death, being well pleased, said to Nachiketa: I 
will now give you another boon: this fire shall be named after 
you. Take also from me this many—coloured chain. 


17 


He who has performed three times this Nachiketa sacrifice, 
having been instructed by the three and also has performed his 
three duties, overcomes birth and death. Having known this 
Fire born of Brahman, omniscient, luminous and adorable and 
realised it, he attains supreme peace. 


18 


He who, having known the three, has performed three times the 
Nachiketa sacrifice, throws off, even here, the chains of death, 
overcomes grief and rejoices in Heaven. 


19 


This, O Nachiketa, is your Fire—sacrifice, which leads to 
Heaven and which you have chosen as your second boon. 
People will call this Fire by your name. Now, O Nachiketa, 
choose the third boon. 


20 

Nachiketa said: There is this doubt about a man when he is 
dead: Some say that he exists; others, that he does not. This I 
should like to know, taught by you. This is the third of my 
boons. 


21 


Yama said: On this subject even the gods formerly had their 
doubts. It is not easy to understand: the nature of Atman is 





subtle. Choose another boon, O Nachiketa! Do not press me. 
Release me from that boon. 


22 


Nachiketa said: O Death, even the gods have their doubts about 
this subject; and you have declared it to be not easy to 
understand. But another teacher like you cannot be found and 
surely no other boon is comparable to this. 


23 


Yama said: Choose sons and grandsons who shall live a 
hundred years; choose elephants, horses, herds of cattle and 
gold. Choose a vast domain on earth; live here as many years as 
you desires. 


24 


If you deem any other boon equal to that, choose it; choose 
wealth and a long life. Be the king, O Nachiketa, of the wide 
earth. I will make you the enjoyer of all desires. 


25 


Whatever desires are difficult to satisfy in this world of 
mortals, choose them as you wish: these fair maidens, with 
their chariots and musical instruments — men cannot obtain 
them. I give them to you and they shall wait upon you. But do 
not ask me about death. 


26 


Nachiketa said: But, O Death, these endure only till tomorrow. 
Furthermore, they exhaust the vigour of all the sense organs. 
Even the longest life is short indeed. Keep your horses, dances 
and songs for yourself. 


27 


Wealth can never make a man happy. Moreover, since I have 
beheld you, I shall certainly obtain wealth; I shall also live as 
long as you rule. Therefore no boon will be accepted by me but 
the one that I have asked. 


28 
Who among decaying mortals here below, having approached 


the undecaying immortals and coming to know that his higher 
needs may be fulfilled by them, would exult in a life over long, 





after he had pondered on the pleasures arising from beauty and 
song? 


29 


Tell me, O Death, of that Great Hereafter about which a man 
has his doubts. 


Chapter II 
1 


Yama said: The good is one thing; the pleasant, another. Both 
of these, serving different needs, bind a man. It goes well with 
him who, of the two, takes the good; but he who chooses the 
pleasant misses the end. 


2 


Both the good and the pleasant present themselves to a man. 
The calm soul examines them well and discriminates. Yea, he 
prefers the good to the pleasant; but the fool chooses the 
pleasant out of greed and avarice. 


3 


O Nachiketa, after pondering well the pleasures that are or 
seem to he delightful, you have renounced them all. You have 
not taken the road abounding in wealth, where many men sink. 


4 


Wide apart and leading to different ends are these two: 
ignorance and what is known as Knowledge. I regard you, O 
Nachiketa, to be one who desires Knowledge; for even many 
pleasures could not tempt you away. 


5 

Fools dwelling in darkness, but thinking themselves wise and 
erudite, go round and round, by various tortuous paths, like the 
blind led by the blind. 

6 

The Hereafter never reveals itself to a person devoid of 
discrimination, heedless and perplexed by the delusion of 


wealth. "This world alone exists," he thinks, "and there is no 
other." Again and again he comes under my sway. 





7 


Many there are who do not even hear of Atman; though hearing 
of Him, many do not comprehend. Wonderful is the expounder 
and rare the hearer; rare indeed is the experiencer of Atman 
taught by an able preceptor. 


8 


Atman, when taught by an inferior person, is not easily 
comprehended, because It is diversely regarded by disputants. 
But when It is taught by him who has become one with Atman, 
there can remain no more doubt about It. Atman is subtler than 
the subtlest and not to be known through argument. 


9 


This Knowledge cannot be attained by reasoning. Atman 
become easy of comprehension, O dearest, when taught by 
another. You have attained this Knowledge now. You are, 
indeed, a man of true resolve. May we always have an inquirer 
like you! 


10 


Yama said: I know that the treasure resulting from action is not 
eternal; for what is eternal cannot be obtained by the non— 
eternal. Yet I have performed the Nachiketa sacrifice with the 
help of non—eternal things and attained this position which is 
only relatively eternal. 


i 


The fulfilment of desires, the foundation of the universe, the 
rewards of sacrifices, the shore where there is no fear, that 
which adorable and great, the wide abode and the goal—all this 
you have seen; and being wise, you have with firm resolve 
discarded everything. 


12 

The wise man who, by means of concentration on the Self, 
realises that ancient, effulgent One, who is hard to be seen, 
unmanifest, hidden and who dwells in the buddhi and rests in 
the body—he, indeed, leaves joy and sorrow far behind. 


13 


The mortal who has heard this and comprehended it well, who 
has separated that Atman, the very soul of dharma, from all 





physical objects and has realised the subtle essence, rejoices 
because he has obtained that which is the cause of rejoicing. 
The Abode of Brahman, I believe, is open for Nachiketa. 


14 


Nachiketa said: That which you see as other than righteousness 
and unrighteousness, other than all this cause and effect, other 
than what has been and what is to be—tell me That. 


15 


Yama said: The goal which all the Vedas declare, which all 
austerities aim at and which men desire when they lead the life 
of continence, I will tell you briefly: it is Om. 


16 


This syllable Om is indeed Brahman. This syllable is the 
Highest. Whosoever knows this syllable obtains all that he 
desires. 


17 


This is the best support; this is the highest support. Whosoever 
knows this support is adored in the world of Brahma. 


18 


The knowing Self is not born; It does not die. It has not sprung 
from anything; nothing has sprung from It. Birthless, eternal, 
everlasting and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed. 


19 

If the killer thinks he kills and if the killed man thinks he is 
killed, neither of these apprehends aright. The Self kills not, nor 
is It killed. 

20 

Atman, smaller than the small, greater than the great, is hidden 
in the hearts of all living creatures. A man who is free from 


desires beholds the majesty of the Self through tranquillity of 
the senses and the mind and becomes free from grief. 





21 


Though sitting still, It travels far; though lying down, It goes 
everywhere. Who but myself can know that luminous Atman 
who rejoices and rejoices not? 


22 


The wise man, having realised Atman as dwelling within 
impermanent bodies but Itself bodiless, vast and all— 
pervading, does not grieve. 


23 


This Atman cannot be attained by the study of the Vedas, or by 
intelligence, or by much hearing of sacred books. It is attained 
by him alone whom It chooses. To such a one Atman reveals 
Its own form. 


24 


He who has not first turn away from wickedness, who is not 
tranquil and subdued and whose mind is not at peace, cannot 
attain Atman. It is realised only through the Knowledge of 
Reality. 


25 


Who, then, knows where He is—He to whom Brahmins and 
kshattriyas are mere food and death itself a condiment? 


Chapter III 
i 


Two there are who dwell within the body, in the intellect, the 
supreme akasa of the heart, enjoying the sure rewards of their 
own actions. The knowers of Brahman describe them as light 
and shade, as do those householders who have offered oblations 
in the Five Fires and also those who have thrice performed the 
Nachiketa sacrifice. 


2 
We know how to perform the Nachiketa sacrifice, which is the 
bridge for sacrificers; and we know also that supreme, 


imperishable Brahman, which is sought by those who wish to 
cross over to the shore where there is no fear. 


 


3 


Know the atman to be the master of the chariot; the body, 
chariot; the intellect, the charioteer; and the mind, the reins. 


4 


The senses, they say, are the horses; the objects, the roads. The 
wise call the atman—united with the body, the senses and the 
mind—the enjoyer. 


. 


If the buddhi, being related to a mind that is always distracted, 
loses its discriminations, then the senses become uncontrolled, 
like the vicious horses of a charioteer. 


6 


But if the buddhi, being related to a mind that is always 
restrained, possesses discrimination, then the senses come 
under control, like the good horses of a charioteer. 


7 


If the buddhi, being related to a distracted mind, loses its 
discrimination and therefore always remains impure, then the 
embodied soul never attains the goal, but enters into the round 
of births. 


8 


But if the buddhi, being related to a mind that is restrained, 
possesses discrimination and therefore always remains pure, 
then the embodied soul attains that goal from which he is not 
born again. 


9 


A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the 
reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is 
the supreme position of Vishnu. 


10—11 


Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the 
mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the 
Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; 
beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there 
is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal. 


 


12 


That Self hidden in all beings does not shine forth; but It is seen 
by subtle seers through their one—pointed and subtle intellects. 


13 


The wise man should merge his speech in his mind and his 
mind in his intellect. He should merge his intellect in the 
Cosmic Mind and the Cosmic Mind in the Tranquil Self. 


14 


Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn. Like the sharp 
edge of a razor is that path, so the wise say—hard to tread and 
difficult to cross. 


is 


Having realised Atman, which is soundless, intangible, 
formless, undecaying and likewise tasteless, eternal and 
odourless; having realised That which is without beginning and 
end, beyond the Great and unchanging—one is freed from the 
jaws of death. 


16 


The wise man who has heard and related the eternal story of 
Nachiketa, told by Death, is adored in the world of Brahman. 


17 
And he who, practising self—control, recites the supreme 
secret in an assembly of Brahmins or at a after—death 


ceremony obtains thereby infinite rewards. Yea, he obtains 
infinite rewards. 


Part Two 

Chapter I 

1 

Yama said: The self—existent Supreme Lord inflicted an injury 
upon the sense—organs in creating them with outgoing 
tendencies; therefore a man perceives only outer objects with 


them and not the inner Self. But a calm person, wishing for 
Immortality, beholds the inner Self with his eyes closed. 


 


2 


Children pursue outer pleasures and fall into the net of 
widespread death; but calm souls, having known what is 
unshakable Immortality, do not covet any uncertain thing in 
this world. 


3 


It is through Atman that one knows form, taste, smell, sounds, 
touches and carnal pleasures. Is there anything that remains 
unknown to Atman? This, verily, is That. 


4 


It is through Atman that one perceives all objects in sleep or in 
the waking state. Having realised the vast, all—pervading 
Atman, the calm soul does not grieve. 


5 


He who knows the individual soul, the experiencer of the fruits 
of action, as Atman, always near and the Lord of the past and 
the future, will not conceal himself from others. This, verily, is 
That. 


6 


He verily knows Brahman who knows the First—born, the 
offspring of austerity, created prior to the waters and dwelling, 
with the elements, in the cave of the heart. This, verily, is That. 


7 


He verily knows Brahman who knows Aditi, the soul of all 
deities, who was born in the form of Prana, who was created 
with the elements and who, entering into the heart, abides 
therein. This, verily, is That. 


8 
Agni, hidden in the two fire—sticks and well guarded—like a 
child in the womb, by its mother—is worshipped day after day 


by men who are awake and by those who offer oblations in the 
sacrifices. This, verily, is That. 


 


9 


Whence the sun rises and whither it goes to set, in whom all the 
devas are contained and whom none can ever pass beyond— 
This, verily, is That. 


10 


What is here, the same is there and what is there, the same is 
here. He goes from death to death who sees any difference 
here. 


11 


By the mind alone is Brahman to be realised; then one does not 
see in It any multiplicity whatsoever. He goes from death to 
death who sees multiplicity in It. This, verily, is That. 


12 


The Purusha, of the size of a thumb, dwells in the body. He is 
the Lord of the past and the future. After knowing Him, one 
does not conceal oneself any more. This, verily, is That. 


13 


The Purusha, of the size of a thumb, is like a flame without 
smoke. The Lord of the past and the future, He is the same 
today and tomorrow. This, verily, is That. 


14 

As rainwater falling on a mountain peak runs down the rocks in 
all directions, even so he who sees the attributes as different 
from Brahman verily runs after them in all directions. 


15 


As pure water poured into pure water becomes one with it, so 
also, O Gautama, does the Self of the sage who knows. 


Chapter II 

1 

There is a city with eleven gates belonging to the unborn 
Atman of undistorted Consciousness. He who meditates on 


Him grieves no more; liberated from the bonds of ignorance, he 
becomes free. This, verily, is That. 


 


2 


He is the sun dwelling in the bright heavens. He is the air in the 
interspace. He is the fire dwelling on earth. He is the guest 
dwelling in the house. He dwells in men, in the gods, in truth, 
in the sky. He is born in the water, on earth, in the sacrifice, on 
the mountains. He is the True and the Great. 


a 


He it is who sends prana upward and who leads apana 
downward. All the devas worship that adorable One seated in 
the middle. 


4 


When the soul, identified with the body and dwelling in it, is 
torn away from the body, is freed from it, what then remains? 
This, verily, is That? 


5 


No mortal ever lives by prana, which goes up, nor by apana, 
which goes down. Men live by something different, on which 
these two depend. 


6 


Well then, Gautama, I shall tell you about this profound and 
eternal Brahman and also about what happens to the atman 
after meeting death. 


7 


Some jivas enter the womb to be embodied as organic beings 
and some go into non—organic matter—according to their 
work and according to their knowledge. 


8 


He, the Purusha, who remains awake while the sense—organs 
are asleep, shaping one lovely form after another, that indeed is 
the Pure, that is Brahman and that alone is called the Immortal. 
All worlds are contained in Him and none can pass beyond. 
This, verily, is That. 


9 


As the same non—dual fire, after it has entered the world, 
becomes different according to whatever it burns, so also the 


 


same non—dual Atman, dwelling in all beings, becomes 
different according to whatever It enters. And It exists also 
without. 


10 


As the same non—dual air, after it has entered the world, 
becomes different according to whatever it enters, so also the 
same non—dual Atman, dwelling in all beings, becomes 
different according to whatever It enters. And It exists also 
without. 


11 


As the sun, which helps all eyes to see, is not affected by the 
blemishes of the eyes or of the external things revealed by it, so 
also the one Atman, dwelling in all beings, is never 
contaminated by the misery of the world, being outside it. 


12 


There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings, who 
makes His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the 
wise, who perceive Him within themselves—not to others. 


13 


There is One who is the eternal Reality among non—eternal 
objects, the one truly conscious Entity among conscious objects 
and who, though non—dual, fulfils the desires of many. Eternal 
peace belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within 
themselves—not to others. 


14 

The sages realise that indescribable Supreme Joy as "This is 
That." How can I realise It? Is It self—luminous? Does It shine 
brightly, or not? 

15 

The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor 


these lightnings—not to speak of this fire. He shining, 
everything shines after Him. By His light all this is lighted. 


 


Chapter III 
1 


This is that eternal Asvattha Tree with its root above and 
branches below. That root, indeed, is called the Bright; That is 
Brahman and That alone is the Immortal. In That all worlds are 
contained and none can pass beyond. This, verily, is That. 


2 


Whatever there is—the whole universe—vibrates because it has 
gone forth from Brahman, which exists as its Ground. That 
Brahman is a great terror, like a poised thunderbolt. Those who 
know It become immortal. 


3 


From terror of Brahman, fire burns; from terror of It, the sun 
shines; from terror of It, Indra and Vayu and Death, the fifth, 
run. 


4 


If a man is able to realise Brahman here, before the falling 
asunder of his body, then he is liberated; if not, he is embodied 
again in the created worlds. 


5 


As in a mirror, so in the buddhi; as in a dream, so in the World 
of the Fathers; as in water, so Brahman is seen in the World of 
the Gandharvas; as in light and shade, so in the World of 
Brahma. 


6 

Having understood that the senses have their separate origin 
and that they are distinct from Atman and also that their rising 
and setting belong to them alone, a wise man grieves no more. 
a 

Beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, 


higher than the intellect is the Great Atman, higher than the 
Great Atman is the Unmanifest. 


 


8 


Beyond the Unmanifest is the Person, all—pervading and 
imperceptible. Having realised Him, the embodied self 
becomes liberated and attains Immortality. 


9 


His form is not an object of vision; no one beholds Him with 
the eye. One can know Him when He is revealed by the 
intellect free from doubt and by constant meditation. Those 
who know this become immortal. 


10 


When the five instruments of knowledge stand still, together 
with the mind and when the intellect does not move, that is 
called the Supreme State. 


11 


This, the firm Control of the senses, is what is called yoga. One 
must then be vigilant; for yoga can be both beneficial and 
injurious. 


12 


Atman cannot be attained by speech, by the mind, or by the 
eye. How can It be realised in any other way than by the 
affirmation of him who says: "He is"? 


13 

He is to be realised first as Existence limited by upadhis and 
then in His true transcendental nature. Of these two aspects, 
Atman realised as Existence leads the knower to the realisation 
of His true nature. 


14 


When all the desires that dwell in the heart fall away, then the 
mortal becomes immortal and here attains Brahman. 


15 


When all the ties of the heart are severed here on earth, then the 
mortal becomes immortal. This much alone is the teaching. 


 


16 


There are one hundred and one arteries of the heart, one of 
which pierces the crown of the head. Going upward by it, a 
man at death attains immortality. But when his prana passes out 
by other arteries, going in different directions, then he is reborn 
in the world. 


17 


The Purusha, not larger than a thumb, the inner Self, always 
dwells in the hearts of men. Let a man separate Him from his 
body with steadiness, as one separates the tender stalk from a 
blade of grass. Let him know that Self as the Bright, as the 
Immortal—yea, as the Bright, as the Immortal. 


18 


Having received this wisdom taught by the King of Death and 
the entire process of yoga, Nachiketa became free from 
impurities and death and attained Brahman. Thus it will be also 
with any other who knows, in this manner, the inmost Self. 


End of Katha Upanishad 
Peace Chant 


Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 
us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 
Truth! May we cherish no ill feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Invocation 
Om. That is full; this is full. This fullness has been projected 
from that fullness. When this fullness merges in that fullness, 


all that remains is fullness. 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Isa Upanishad 


All this—whatever exists in this changing universe—should be 
covered by the Lord. Protect the Self by renunciation. Lust not 
after any man's wealth. 


2 


If a man wishes to live a hundred years on this earth, he should 
live performing action. For you, who cherish such a desire and 
regard yourself as a man, there is no other way by which you 
can keep work from clinging to you. 


3 


Verily, those worlds of the asuras are enveloped in blind 
darkness; and thereto they all repair after death who are slayers 
of Atman. 


4 


That non—dual Atman, though never stirring, is swifter than 
the mind. The senses cannot reach It, for It moves ever in front. 
Though standing still, It overtakes others who are running. 
Because of Atman, Vayu, the World Soul apportions the 
activities of all. 


5 


It moves and moves not; It is far and likewise near. It is inside 
all this and It is outside all this. 


6 


The wise man beholds all beings in the Self and the Self in all 
beings; for that reason he does not hate anyone. 


7 

To the seer, all things have verily become the Self: what 
delusion, what sorrow, can there be for him who beholds that 
oneness? 

8 

It is He who pervades all—He who is bright and bodiless, 


without scar or sinews, pure and by evil unpierced; who is the 


 


Seer, omniscient, transcendent and uncreated. He has duly 
allotted to the eternal World—Creators their respective duties. 


9 


Into a blind darkness they enter who are devoted to ignorance 
(rituals); but into a greater darkness they enter who engage in 
knowledge of a deity alone. 


10 


One thing, they say, is obtained from knowledge; another, they 
say, from ignorance. Thus we have heard from the wise who 
have taught us this. 


11 


He who is aware that both knowledge and ignorance should be 
pursued together, overcomes death through ignorance and 
obtains immortality through knowledge. 


12 


Into a blind darkness they enter who worship only the 
unmanifested prakriti; but into a greater darkness they enter 
who worship the manifested Hiranyagarbha. 


13 


One thing, they say, is obtained from the worship of the 
manifested; another, they say, from the worship of the 
unmanifested. Thus we have heard from the wise who taught us 
this. 


14 

He who knows that both the unmanifested prakriti and the 
manifested Hiranyagarbha should be worshipped together, 
overcomes death by the worship of Hiranyagarbha and obtains 
immortality through devotion to prakriti. 

15 

The door of the Truth is covered by a golden disc. Open it, O 


Nourisher! Remove it so that I who have been worshipping the 
Truth may behold It. 


 


16 


O Nourisher, lone Traveller of the sky! Controller! O Sun, 
Offspring of Prajapati! Gather Your rays; withdraw Your light. 
I would see, through Your grace, that form of Yours which is 
the fairest. I am indeed He, that Purusha, who dwells there. 


17 


Now may my breath return to the all—pervading, immortal 
Prana! May this body be burnt to ashes! Om. O mind, 
remember, remember all that I have done. 


18 


O Fire, lead us by the good path for the enjoyment of the fruit 
of our action. You know, O god, all our deeds. Destroy our sin 
of deceit. We offer, by words, our salutations to you. 


End of Isa Upanishad 
The Peace Chant 


Om. That is full; this is full. This fullness has been projected 
from that fullness. When this fullness merges in that fullness, 
all that remains is fullness. 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Invocation 


Om. May Brahman protect us both (the preceptor and the 
disciple)! May Brahman bestow upon us both the fruit of 
Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy to acquire 
Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the Truth! May we 
cherish no ill feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Om. May the different parts of my body, my tongue, prana, 
eyes, ears and my strength and also all the sense—organs, be 
nourished! All, indeed, is Brahman, as is declared in the 
Upanishads. May I never deny Brahman! May Brahman never 
deny me! May there never be denial on the part of Brahman! 
May there never be denial on my part! May all the virtues 
described in the Upanishads belong to me, who am devoted to 
Brahman! 

Yea, may they all belong to me! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Kena Upanishad 


Chapter I 
1 


The disciple asked: Om. By whose will directed does the mind 
proceed to its object? At whose command does the prana, the 
foremost, do its duty? At whose will do men utter speech? Who 
is the god that directs the eyes and ears? 


2 


The teacher replied: It is the Ear of the ear, the Mind of the 
mind, the Speech of speech, the Life of life and the Eye of the 
eye. Having detached the Self from the sense—organs and 
renounced the world, the Wise attain to Immortality. 


34 


The eye does not go thither, nor speech, nor the mind. We do 
not know It; we do not understand how anyone can teach It. It 
is different from the known; It is above the unknown. Thus we 
have heard from the preceptors of old who taught It to us. 


5 


That which cannot be expressed by speech, but by which 
speech is expressed—That alone know as Brahman and not that 
which people here worship. 


6 


That which cannot be apprehended by the mind, but by which, 
they say, the mind is apprehended—That alone know as 
Brahman and not that which people here worship. 


7 

That which cannot be perceived by the eye, but by which the 
eye is perceived—That alone know as Brahman and not that 
which people here worship. 

8 

That which cannot he heard by the ear, but by which the 


hearing is perceived—That alone know as Brahman and not 
that which people here worship. 


 


9 


That which cannot be smelt by the breath, but by which the 
breath smells an object—That alone know as Brahman and not 
that which people here worship. 


Chapter II 
1 


The teacher said: If you think: "I know Brahman well," then 
surely you know but little of Its form; you know only Its form 
as conditioned by man or by the gods. Therefore Brahman, 
even now, is worthy of your inquiry. 


2 


The disciple said: I think I know Brahman. 

The disciple said: I do not think I know It well, nor do I think I 
do not know It. He among us who knows the meaning of 
"Neither do I not know, nor do I know"—knows Brahman. 


2 


He by whom Brahman is not known, knows It; he by whom It 
is known, knows It not. It is not known by those who know It; 
It is known by those who do not know It. 


4 


Brahman is known when It is realised in every state of mind; 
for by such Knowledge one attains Immortality. By Atman one 
obtains strength; by Knowledge, Immortality 


5 


If a man knows Atman here, he then attains the true goal of life. 
If he does not know It here, a great destruction awaits him. 
Having realised the Self in every being, the wise relinquish the 
world and become immortal. 


Chapter III 

1 

Brahman, according to the story, obtained a victory for the 
gods; and by that victory of Brahman the gods became elated. 


They said to themselves: "Verily, this victory is ours; verily, 
this glory is ours only." 


 


2 


Brahman, to be sure, understood it all and appeared before 
them. But they did not know who that adorable Spirit was. 


3—6 


They said to Agni (Fire): "O Agni! Find out who this great 
Spirit is." "Yes," he said and hastened to It. Brahman asked 
him: "Who are you?" He replied: "I am known as Agni; Iam 
also called Jataveda." Brahman said: "What power is in you, 
who are so well known?" Fire replied: "I can burn all— 
whatever there is on earth." Brahman put a straw before him 
and said: "Burn this." He rushed toward it with all his ardour 
but could not burn it. Then he returned from the Spirit and said 
to the gods: "I could not find out who this Spirit is," 


7—10 


Then they said to Vayu (Air): "O Vayu! Find out who this great 
Spirit is." "Yes," he said and hastened to It. Brahman asked 
him: "Who are you?" He replied "I am known as Vayu; I am 
also called Matarisva." Brahman said: "What power is in you, 
who are so well known?" Vayu replied: "I can carry off all— 
whatever there is on earth." Brahman put a straw before him 
and said: "Carry this." He rushed toward it with all his ardour 
but could not move it. Then he returned from the Spirit and said 
to the gods: "I could not find out who this Spirit is," 


11—12 


Then the gods said to Indra: "O Maghavan! Find out who this 
great Spirit is." "Yes," he said and hastened to It. But the Spirit 
disappeared from him. Then Indra beheld in that very region of 
the sky a Woman highly adorned. She was Uma, the daughter 
of the Himalayas. He approached Her and said: "Who is this 
great Spirit?" 


Chapter IV 
1 
She replied: "It is, indeed, Brahman. Through the victory of 


Brahman alone have you attained glory." After that Indra 
understood that It was Brahman. 


 


2 


Since they approached very near Brahman and were the first to 
know that It was Brahman, these devas, namely, Agni, Vayu 
and Indra, excelled the other gods. 


a 


Since Indra approached Brahman nearest and since he was the 
first to know that It was Brahman, Indra excelled the other 
gods. 


4 


This is the instruction about Brahman with regard to the gods: 
It is like a flash of lightning; It is like a wink of the eye. 


5 


Now the instruction about Brahman with regard to the 
individual self: The mind, as it were, goes to Brahman. The 
seeker, by means of the mind, communes with It intimately 
again and again. This should be the volition of his mind. 


6 

That Brahman is called Tadvana, the Adorable of all; It should 
be worshipped by the name of Tadvana. All creatures desire 
him who worships Brahman thus. 

7 

The disciple said; "Teach me, sir, the Upanishad." 

The preceptor replied: "I have already told you the Upanishad. I 
have certainly told you the Upanishad about Brahman." 


8 


Austerities, self—restraint and sacrificial rites are Its feet and 
the Vedas are all Its limbs. Truth is Its abode. 


9 
He who thus knows this Upanishad shakes off all sins and 
becomes firmly established in the infinite and the highest 


Heaven, yea, the highest Heaven. 


End of Kena Upanishad 


 


The Peace Chant 


Om. May Brahman protect us both (the preceptor and the 
disciple)! May Brahman bestow upon us both the fruit of 
Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy to acquire 
Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the Truth! May we 
cherish no ill feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Om. May the different parts of my body, my tongue, prana, 
eyes, ears and my strength and also all the sense—organs, be 
nourished! All, indeed, is Brahman, as is declared in the 
Upanishads. May I never deny Brahman! May Brahman never 
deny me! May there never be denial on the part of Brahman! 
May there never be denial on my part! May all the virtues 
described in the Upanishads belong to me, who am devoted to 
Brahman! 

Yea, may they all belong to me! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Invocation 


Om. May we, O gods, hear with our ears what is auspicious! 
May we, O worshipful gods, see with our eyes what is good! 
May we, strong in limbs and body, sing your praise and enjoy 
the life allotted to us by Prajapati! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 





Mundaka Upanishad 


First Mundaka 
Chapter I 
1 


Om. Brahma, the Maker of the universe and the Preserver of 
the world, was the first among the devas. He told His eldest son 
Atharva about the Knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of 
all knowledge. 


2 


The Knowledge of Brahman about which Brahma told Atharva, 
Atharva, in olden times, told Angir. Angir taught it to 
Satyavaha, belonging to the clan of Bharadvaja and the latter 
taught it, in succession, to Angiras 


3 


Saunaka, the great householder, approached Angiras in the 
proper manner and said: Revered sir, what is that by the 
knowing of which all this becomes known? 


4 


To him he said: Two kinds of knowledge must be known—that 
is what the knowers of Brahman tell us. They are the Higher 
Knowledge and the lower knowledge. 


5 


Of these two, the lower knowledge is the Rig—Veda, the 
Yagur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, the Atharva—Veda, siksha 
(phonetics), kalpa (rituals), vyakaranam (grammar), nirukta 
(etymology), chhandas (metre) and jyotis (astronomy); and the 
Higher Knowledge is that by which the Imperishable Brahman 
is attained. 


6 


By means of the Higher Knowledge the wise behold 
everywhere Brahman, which otherwise cannot be seen or 
seized, which has no root or attributes, no eyes or ears, no 
hands or feet; which is eternal and omnipresent, all—pervading 
and extremely subtle; which is imperishable and the source of 
all beings. 


 


a 


As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow 
on the earth, as hair grows on the head and the body of a living 
man—so does everything in the universe arise from the 
Imperishable. 


8 


Brahman expands by means of austerity and from It primal 
matter is produced; from matter, Prana; from Prana, mind; from 
mind, the elements; from the elements, the worlds; thence 
works and from the works, their immortal fruits. 


9 


For him who knows all and understands everything, whose 
austerity consists of knowledge—from Him, the Imperishable 
Brahman, are born Brahma, name, form and food. 


Chapter II 
1 


This is the Truth: The sacrificial works which were revealed to 
the rishis in the hymns have been described in many ways in 
the three Vedas. Practise them, being desirous to attain their 
true results. This is your path leading to the fruits of your 
works. 


2 


When the fire is well lighted and the flames flicker, let a man 
offer his oblations in the space between the two portions of 
melted butter. 


3 


If a man's Agnihotra sacrifice is not accompanied by the Darsa 
and the Paurnamasa sacrifice, by the Four Months' sacrifice 
and the Autumnal sacrifice; if it is unattended by hospitality to 
guests or if the oblations are not offered at the right time; or if 
the sacrifice is unaccompanied by the Vaisvadeva ceremony or 
is improperly performed—then it destroys his seven worlds. 


4 
Kali (the Black), Karali (the Terrific), Manojava (the Swift as 


thought), Sulohita (the Very red), Sudhumravarna (of the 
colour of bright smoke; purple), Splulingini (the Scintillating) 


 


and the luminous Visvaruchi (the All—gleaming, all— 
formed)—these seven, flickering about, form the seven tongues 
of the fire. 


5 


A man who performs the sacrifices when these flames are 
shining and offers oblations at the right time, is carried by these 
oblations on the rays of the sun to where dwells the sole 
sovereign of the gods. 


6 


The luminous oblations say to the sacrifiers: Come hither! 
Come hither! And lead him on the rays of the sun, worshipping 
him all the while and greeting him with the pleasant words: 
This is the holy heaven of Brahma, earned by your good deeds. 


7 


But frail indeed are those rafts of sacrifices, conducted by 
eighteen persons, upon whom rests the inferior work; therefore 
they are destructible. Fools who rejoice in them as the Highest 
Good fall victims again and again to old age and death. 


8 


Fools, dwelling in darkness, but wise in their own conceit and 
puffed up with vain scholarship, wander about, being afflicted 
by many ills, like blind men led by the blind. 


9 


Children, immersed in ignorance in various ways, flatter 
themselves, saying: We have accomplished life's purpose. 
Because these performers of karma do not know the Truth 
owing to their attachment, they fall from heaven, misery— 
stricken, when the fruit of their work is exhausted. 


10 

Ignorant fools, regarding sacrifices and humanitarian works as 
the highest, do not know any higher good. Having enjoyed their 
reward on the heights of heaven, gained by good works, they 
enter again this world or a lower one. 


11 


But those wise men of tranquil minds who lives in the forest on 
alms, practising penances appropriate to their stations of life 


 


and contemplating such deities as Hiranyagarbha, depart, freed 
from impurities, by the Path of the Sun, to the place where that 
immortal Person dwells whose nature is imperishable. 


12 


Let a brahmin, after having examined all these worlds that are 
gained by works, acquire freedom from desires: nothing that is 
eternal can be produced by what is not eternal. In order that he 
may understand that Eternal, let him, fuel in hand, approach a 
guru who is well versed in the Vedas and always devoted to 
Brahman. 


13 


To that pupil who has duly approached him, whose mind is 
completely serene and whose senses are controlled, the wise 
teacher should indeed rightly impart the Knowledge of 
Brahman, through which one knows the immutable and the true 
Purusha. 


Second Mundaka 
Chapter I 
1 


This is the Truth: As from a blazing fire, sparks essentially akin 
to it fly forth by the thousand, so also, my good friend, do 
various beings come forth from the imperishable Brahman and 
unto Him again return. 


2 


He is the self—luminous and formless Purusha, uncreated and 
existing both within and without. He is devoid of prana, devoid 
of mind, pure and higher than the supreme Imperishable. 


3 


From Him are born prana, mind, all the sense—organs, Akasa, 
air, fire, water and earth, which supports all. 


4 


The heavens are His head; the sun and moon, His eyes; the 
quarters, His ears; the revealed Vedas, His speech; the wind is 
His breath; the universe, His heart. From his feet is produced 
the earth. He is, indeed, the inner Self of all beings 

 


5 


From Him comes the Fire whose fuel is the sun; from the moon 
comes rain; from rain, the herbs that grow on the earth; from 
the herbs, the seminal fluid which a man pours into a woman. 
Thus many living beings are born of the Purusha. 


6 


From Him have come the Rik, the Saman, the Yajus, the 
Diksha, all sacrifices, the Kratus, gifts, the year, the sacrificer 
and the worlds which the moon sanctifies and the sun 
illumines. 


2 


By Him are begotten the various devas, the sadhyas, men, 
cattle, birds and also prana and apana, rice and corn, penance, 
faith, truth, continence and law. 


8 


From Him have sprung the seven pranas, the seven flames, the 
seven kinds of fuel, the seven oblations and also the seven 
planes where move the pranas, lying in the cave, which are 
seven in each living being. 


9 


From Him come all the oceans and the mountains; from Him 
flow rivers of every kind; from Him have come, as well, all 
plants and flavours, by which the inner self subsists surrounded 
by the elements. 


10 


The Purusha alone is verily the universe, which consists of 
work and austerity. O my good friend, he who knows this 
Brahman—the Supreme and the Immortal, hidden in the cave 
of the heart—cuts asunder even here the knot of ignorance. 


Chapter II 

i 

The Luminous Brahman dwells in the cave of the heart and is 
known to move there. It is the great support of all; for in It is 


centred everything that moves, breathes and blinks. O disciples, 
know that to be your Self—that which is both gross and subtle, 


: 


which is adorable, supreme and beyond the understanding of 
creatures. 


2 


That which is radiant, subtler than the subtle, That by which all 
the worlds and their inhabitants are supported—That, verily, is 
the indestructible Brahman; That is the prana, speech and the 
mind; That is the True and That is the Immortal. That alone is 
to be struck. Strike It, my good friend. 


a 


Take the Upanishad as the bow, the great weapon and place 
upon it the arrow sharpened by meditation. Then, having drawn 
it back with a mind directed to the thought of Brahman, strike 
that mark, O my good friend—that which is the Imperishable 


4 


Om is the bow; the atman is the arrow; Brahman is said to be 
the mark. It is to be struck by an undistracted mind. Then the 
atman becomes one with Brahman, as the arrow with the target. 


2 


In Him are woven heaven, earth and the space between and the 
mind with all the sense—organs. Know that non—dual Atman 
alone and give up all other talk. He is the bridge to Immortality. 


6 


He moves about, becoming manifold, within the heart, where 
the arteries meet, like the spokes fastened in the nave of a 
chariot wheel. Meditate on Atman as Om. Hail to you! May 
you cross beyond the sea of darkness! 


o 


He who knows all and understands all and to whom belongs all 
the glory in the world—He, Atman, is placed in the space in the 
effulgent abode of Brahman. He assumes the forms of the mind 
and leads the body and the senses. He dwells in the body, inside 
the heart. By the knowledge of That which shines as the blissful 
and immortal Atman, the wise behold Him fully in all things. 


 


8 


The fetters of the heart are broken, all doubts are resolved and 
all works cease to bear fruit, when He is beheld who is both 
high and low. 


9 


There the stainless and indivisible Brahman shines in the 
highest, golden sheath. It is pure; It is the Light of lights; It is 
That which they know who know the Self. 


10 


The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor 
these lightnings, not to speak of this fire. When He shines, 
everything shines after Him; by His light everything is lighted. 


11 


That immortal Brahman alone is before, that Brahman is 
behind, that Brahman is to the right and left. Brahman alone 
pervades everything above and below; this universe is that 
Supreme Brahman alone. 


Third Mundaka 
Chapter I 
1 


Two birds, united always and known by the same name, closely 
cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit; the 
other looks on without eating. 


2 


Seated on the same tree, the jiva moans, bewildered by his 
impotence. But when he beholds the other, the Lord 
worshipped by all and His glory, he then becomes free from 
grief. 


3 
When the seer beholds the self—luminous Creator, the Lord, 
the Purusha, the progenitor of Brahma, then he, the wise seer, 


shakes off good and evil, becomes stainless and reaches the 
supreme unity. 


 


4 


He indeed is Prana; He shines forth variously in all beings. The 
wise man who knows Him does not babble. Revelling in the 
Self, delighting in the Self, performing actions, he is the 
foremost among the knowers of Brahman. 


5 


This Atman, resplendent and pure, whom the sinless sannyasins 
behold residing within the body, is attained by unceasing 
practice of truthfulness, austerity, right knowledge and 
continence 


6 


Truth alone prevails, not falsehood. By truth the path is laid 
out, the Way of the Gods, on which the seers, whose every 
desire is satisfied, proceed to the Highest Abode of the True. 


7 


That Brahman shines forth, vast, self—luminous, 
inconceivable, subtler than the subtle. He is far beyond what is 
far and yet here very near at hand. Verily, He is seen here, 
dwelling in the cave of the heart of conscious beings. 


8 


Brahman is not grasped by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the 
other senses, nor by penance or good works. A man becomes 
pure through serenity of intellect; thereupon, in meditation, he 
beholds Him who is without parts. 


9 


That subtle Atman is to be known by the intellect here in the 
body where the prana has entered fivefold. By Atman the 
intellects of men are pervaded, together with the senses. When 
the intellect is purified, Atman shines forth. 


10 
Whatever world a man of pure understanding envisages in his 
mind and whatever desires he cherishes, that world he conquers 


and those desires he obtains, Therefore let everyone who wants 
prosperity worship the man who knows the Self. 


 


Chapter II 
1 


He, the Knower of the Self, knows that Supreme Abode of 
Brahman, which shines brightly and in which the universe 
rests. Those wise men who, free from desires, worship such a 
person transcend the seed of birth. 


2 


He who, cherishing objects, desires them, is born again here or 
there through his desires, But for him whose desires are 
satisfied and who is established in the Self, all desires vanish 
even here on earth. 


3 


This Atman cannot be attained through study of the Vedas, nor 
through intelligence, nor through much learning. He who 
chooses Atman—by him alone is Atman attained. It is Atman 
that reveals to the seeker Its true nature. 


4 


This Atman cannot be attained by one who is without strength 
or earnestness or who is without knowledge accompanied by 
renunciation. But if a wise man strives by means of these aids, 
his soul enters the Abode of Brahman. 


5 


Having realized Atman, the seers become satisfied with that 
Knowledge. Their souls are established in the Supreme Self, 
they are free from passions and they are tranquil in mind. Such 
calm souls ever devoted to the Self, behold everywhere the 
omnipresent Brahman and in the end enter into It, which is all 
this. 


6 


Having well ascertained the Self, the goal of the Vedantic 
knowledge and having purified their minds through the practice 
of sannyasa, the seers, never relaxing their efforts, enjoy here 
supreme Immortality and at the time of the great end attain 
complete freedom in Brahman. 


 


a 


The fifteen parts go back to their causes and all the senses to 
their deities; the actions and the Atman reflected in the buddhi, 
become one with the highest imperishable Brahman, which is 
the Self of all. 


8 


As flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their names and 
forms, so a wise man, freed from name and form, attains the 
Purusha, who is greater than the Great. 


9 


He who knows the Supreme Brahman verily becomes 
Brahman. In his family no one is born ignorant of Brahman. He 
overcomes grief; he overcomes evil; free from the fetters of the 
heart, he becomes immortal. 


10 


A Rik—verse declares: This Knowledge of Brahman should he 
told to those only who have performed the necessary duties, 
who are versed in the Vedas and devoted to Brahman and who, 
full of faith, have offered oblations in the Ekarshi Fire and 
performed, according to rule, the rite of carrying fire on the 
head. 


11 
Thus the seer Angiras declared this truth in olden times. A man 


who has not performed the vow should not read it. Salutation to 
the great seers! Salutation to the great seers!

May we, O worshipful gods, see with our eyes what is good!

Svetasvatara Upanishad 


Chapter I 
1 


Rishis, discoursing on Brahman, ask: Is Brahman the cause? 
Whence are we born? By what do we live? Where do we dwell 
at the end? Please tell us, O ye who know Brahman, under 
whose guidance we abide, whether in pleasure or in pain. 


2 


Should time, or nature, or necessity, or chance, or the elements 
be regarded as the cause? Or he who is called the purusha, the 
living self? 


3 


The sages, absorbed in meditation through one—pointedness of 
mind, discovered the creative power, belonging to the Lord 
Himself and hidden in its own gunas. That non—dual Lord 
rules over all those causes—time, the self and the rest. 


4 


The sages saw the wheel of Brahman, which has one felly, a 
triple tire, sixteen end—parts, fifty spokes with twenty 
counter—spokes and six sets of eight; whose one rope is 
manifold; which moves on three different roads; and whose 
illusion arises from two causes. 


5 


We meditate on the River whose five currents are the five 
organs of perception, which is made impetuous and winding by 
the five elements, whose waves are the five organs of actions 
and whose fountain—head is the mind, the source of the five 
forms of perception. This River has five whirlpools and its 
rapids are the fivefold misery; and lastly, it has fifty branches 
and five pain—bearing obstructions. 


6 


In this great Brahma—Wheel, in which all things abide and 
finally rest, the swan wanders about so long as it thinks the self 
is different from the Controller. When blessed by Him the self 
attains Immortality. 


 


7 


It is the Supreme Brahman alone untouched by phenomena that 
is proclaimed in the Upanishads. In It is established the triad of 
the enjoyer, the object and the Lord who is the Controller. This 
Brahman is the immutable foundation; It is imperishable. The 
sages, having realized Brahman to be the essence of 
phenomena, become devoted to Him. Completely merged in 
Brahman, they attain freedom from rebirth. 


8 


The Lord, Isa, supports all this which has been joined 
together—the perishable and the imperishable, the manifest, the 
effect and the unmanifest, the cause. The same Lord, the 
Supreme Self, devoid of Lordship, becomes bound because of 
assuming the attitude of the enjoyer. The jiva again realizes the 
Supreme Self and is freed from all fetters. 


9 


The Supreme Lord appears as Isvara, omniscient and 
omnipotent and as the jiva, of limited knowledge and power, 
both unborn. But this does not deny the phenomenal universe; 
for there exists further the unborn prakriti, which creates the 
ideas of the enjoyer, enjoyment and the object. Atman is 
infinite and all—pervading and therefore devoid of agency. 
When the seeker knows all these three to be Brahman, he is 
freed from his fetters. 


10 


Prakriti is perishable. Hara, the Lord, is immortal and 
imperishable. The non—dual Supreme Self rules both prakriti 
and the individual soul. Through constant meditation on Him, 
by union with Him, by the knowledge of identity with Him, one 
attains, in the end, cessation of the illusion of phenomena. 


11 


When the Lord is known all fetters fall off; with the cessation 
of miseries, birth and death come to an end. From meditation 
on Him there arises, after the dissolution of the body, the third 
state, that of universal lordship. And lastly, the aspirant, 
transcending that state also, abides in the complete Bliss of 
Brahman. 


 


12 


The enjoyer (jiva), the objects of enjoyment and the Ruler 
(Isvara)—the triad described by the knowers of Brahman—all 
this is nothing but Brahman. This Brahman alone, which abides 
eternally within the self, should be known. Beyond It, truly, 
there is nothing else to be known. 


13 


The visible form of fire, while it lies latent in its source, the 
fire—wood, is not perceived; yet there is no destruction of its 
subtle form. That very fire can be brought out again by means 
of persistent rubbing of the wood, its source. In like manner, 
Atman, which exists in two states, like fire, can be grasped in 
this very body by means of Om. 


14 


By making the body the lower piece of wood and Om the upper 
piece and through the practice of the friction of meditation, one 
perceives the luminous Self, hidden like the fire in the wood. 


15—16 


As oil exists in sesame seeds, butter in milk, water in river— 
beds and fire in wood, so the Self is realized as existing within 
the self, when a man looks for It by means of truthfulness and 
austerity—when he looks for the Self, which pervades all 
things as butter pervades milk and whose roots are Self— 
Knowledge and austerity. That is the Brahman taught by the 
Upanishad; yea, that is the Brahman taught by the Upanishads. 


Chapter II 
1 


May the sun, at the commencement of yoga, join our minds and 
other organs to the Supreme Self so that we may attain the 
Knowledge of Reality. May He, also, support the body, the 
highest material entity, through the powers of the deities who 
control the senses. 


Z 
Having received the blessings of the divine Sun and with minds 
joined to the Supreme Self, we exert ourselves, to the best of 


our power, toward meditation, by which we shall attain Heaven 
(Brahman). 

 


3 


May the Sun bestow favour upon the senses and the mind by 
joining them with the Self, so that the senses may be directed 
toward the Blissful Brahman and may reveal, by means of 
Knowledge, the mighty and radiant Brahman. 


4 


It is the duty of those brahmins who fix their minds and senses 
on the Supreme Self to utter such lofty invocations to the divine 
Sun, omnipresent, mighty and omniscient. For He, all— 
witnessing and non—dual, is the dispenser of sacrifices. 


5 


O senses and O deities who favour them! Through salutations I 
unite myself with the eternal Brahman, who is your source. Let 
this prayer sung by me, who follow the right path of the Sun, 
go forth in all directions. May the sons of the Immortal, who 
occupy celestial positions, hear it! 


6 


If sacrifices are performed without first propitiating the Sun, 
then the mind becomes attached to sacrifices in which fire is 
kindled by the rubbing of the pieces of fire—wood, the 
oblations are offered to the deity Vayu and the soma juice is 
drunk excessively. 


7 


Serve the eternal Brahman with the blessings of the Sun, the 
cause of the universe. Be absorbed, through samadhi, in the 
eternal Brahman. Thus your work will not bind you. 


8 


The wise man should hold his body steady, with the three upper 
parts erect, turn his senses, with the help of the mind, toward 
the heart and by means of the raft of Brahman cross the fearful 
torrents of the world. 


9 
The yogi of well regulated endeavours should control the 
pranas; when they are quieted he should breathe out through the 


nostrils. Then let him undistractedly restrain his mind, as a 
charioteer restrains his vicious horses. 


? 


10 


Let yoga be practised within a cave protected from the high 
wind, or in a place which is level, pure and free from pebbles, 
gravel and fire, undisturbed by the noise of water or of 
market—booths and which is delightful to the mind and not 
offensive to the eye. 


11 


When yoga is practised, the forms which appear first and which 
gradually manifest Brahman are those or snow—flakes, smoke, 
sun, wind, fire, fire—flies, lightning, crystal and the moon. 


12 


When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when 
the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on 
yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified 
by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and 
death. 


13 


The precursors of perfection in yoga, they say, are lightness and 
healthiness of the body, absence of desire, clear complexion, 
pleasantness of voice, sweet odour and slight excretions. 


14 


As gold covered by earth shines bright after it has been 
purified, so also the yogi, realising the truth of Atman, becomes 
one with the non—dual Atman, attains the goal and is free from 
grief 


15 


And when the yogi beholds the real nature of Brahman, through 
the Knowledge of the Self, radiant as a lamp, then, having 
known the unborn and immutable Lord, who is untouched by 
ignorance and its effects, he is freed from all fetters. 


16 


He indeed, the Lord, who pervades all regions, was the first to 
be born and it is He who dwells in the womb of the universe. It 
is He, again, who is born as a child and He will be born in the 
future, He stands behind all persons and His face is 
everywhere. 


 


17 


The Self—luminous Lord, who is fire, who is in water, who has 
entered into the whole world, who is in plants, who is in trees— 
to that Lord let there be adoration! Yea, let there be adoration! 


Chapter III 
1 


The non—dual Ensnarer rules by His powers. Remaining one 
and the same, He rules by His powers all the worlds during 
their manifestation and continued existence. They who know 
this become immortal. 


2 


Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit 
the existence of a second, He alone rules all the worlds by His 
powers. He dwells as the inner Self of every living being. After 
having created all the worlds, He, their Protector, takes them 
back into Himself at the end of time. 


3 


His eyes are everywhere, His faces everywhere, His arms 
everywhere, everywhere His feet. He it is who endows men 
with arms, birds with feet and wings and men likewise with 
feet. Having produced heaven and earth, He remains as their 
non—dual manifester. 


4 


He, the omniscient Rudra, the creator of the gods and the 
bestower of their powers, the support of the universe, He who, 
in the beginning, gave birth to Hiranyagarbha—may He endow 
us with clear intellect! 


5 

O Rudra, Thou who dwellest in the body and bestowest 
happiness! Look upon us with that most blessed form of Thine, 
which is auspicious, unterrifying and all good. 

6 

O Dweller in the body and Bestower of happiness, make benign 


that arrow which Thou holdest in Thy hand ready to shoot, O 
Protector of the body! Do not injure man or the world! 


 


7 


The Supreme Lord is higher than Virat, beyond Hiranyagarbha. 
He is vast and is hidden in the bodies of all living beings. By 
knowing Him who alone pervades the universe, men become 
immortal. 


8 


I know the great Purusha, who is luminous, like the sun and 
beyond darkness. Only by knowing Him does one pass over 
death; there is no other way to the Supreme Goal. 


9 


The whole universe is filled by the Purusha, to whom there is 
nothing superior, from whom there is nothing different, than 
whom there is nothing either smaller or greater; who stands 
alone, motionless as a tree, established in His own glory. 


10 


That which is farthest from this world is without form and 
without affliction They who know It become immortal; but 
others, indeed, suffer pain. 


11 


All faces are His faces; all heads, His heads; all necks, His 
necks. He dwells in the hearts of all beings. He is the all— 
pervading Bhagavan. Therefore He is the omnipresent and 
benign Lord. 


12 


He, indeed, is the great Purusha, the Lord of creation, 
preservation and destruction, who inspires the mind to attain 
the state of stainlessness. He is the Ruler and the Light that is 
imperishable. 


13 
The Purusha, no bigger than a thumb, is the inner Self, ever 
seated in the heart of man. He is known by the mind, which 


controls knowledge and is perceived in the heart. They who 
know Him become immortal. 


 


14 


The Purusha with a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a 
thousand feet, compasses the earth on all sides and extends 
beyond it by ten fingers' breadth. 


15 


The Purusha alone is all this—what has been and what will be. 
He is also the Lord of Immortality and of whatever grows by 
food. 


16 


His hands and feet are everywhere; His eyes, heads and faces 
are everywhere; His ears are everywhere; He exists compassing 
all. 


17 


Himself devoid of senses, He shines through the functions of 
the senses. He is the capable ruler of all; He is the refuge of all. 
He is great. 


18 


The Swan, the ruler of the whole world, of all that is moving 
and all that is motionless, becomes the embodied self and 
dwelling in the city of nine gates, flies outward. 


19 


Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, It sees without 
eyes, It hears without ears. It knows what is to be known, but 
no one knows It. They call It the First, the Great, the Full. 


20 


The Self, smaller than the small, greater than the great, is 
hidden in the hearts of creatures. The wise, by the grace of the 
Creator, behold the Lord, majestic and desireless and become 
free from grief. 


21 
I know this undecaying, primeval One, the Self of all things, 
which exists everywhere, being all—pervading and which the 


wise declare to be free from birth. The teachers of Brahman, 
indeed, speak of It as eternal. 


 


Chapter IV 
1 


He, the One and Undifferentiated, who by the manifold 
application of His powers produces, in the beginning, different 
objects for a hidden purpose and, in the end, withdraws the 
universe into Himself, is indeed the self—luminous—May He 
endow us with clear intellect! 


2 


That Supreme Self is Agni (Fire); It is Aditya (Sun); It is Vayu 
(Wind); It is Chandrama (Moon). That Self is the luminous 
stars; It is Hiranyagarbha; It is water; It is Virat. 


3 


Thou art woman, Thou art man; Thou art youth and maiden 
too. Thou as an old man totterest along on a staff; it is Thou 
alone who, when born, assumest diverse forms. 


4 


Thou art the dark—blue bee; Thou art the green parrot with red 
eyes; Thou art the thunder—cloud, the seasons and the seas. 
Thou art beginningless and all—pervading. From Thee all the 
worlds are born. 





5 


There is one unborn prakriti—red, white and black—which 
gives birth to many creatures like itself. An unborn individual 
soul becomes attached to it and enjoys it, while another unborn 
individual soul leaves it after his enjoyment is completed. 


6 

Two birds, united always and known by the same name, closely 
cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit; the 
other looks on without eating. 

7 

Seated on the same tree, the jiva moans, bewildered by its 


impotence. But when it beholds the other, the Lord worshipped 
by all and His glory, it becomes free from grief. 


 


8 


Of what use are the Vedas to him who does not know that 
indestructible Substance, that akasa—like Brahman, which is 
greater than the unmanifest and wherein the Vedas and all the 
gods are sheltered? Only those who know It attain bliss. 


9 


The sacred verses, the offerings (yajna), the sacrifices (kratu), 
the penances (vrata), the past, the future and all that the Vedas 
declare, have been produced from the imperishable Brahman. 
Brahman projects the universe through the power of Its maya. 
Again, in that universe Brahman as the jiva is entangled 
through maya. 


10 


Know, then, that prakriti is maya and that Great God is the 
Lord of maya. The whole universe is filled with objects which 
are parts of His being. 


11 


By truly realising Him who, though non—dual, dwells in 
prakriti, both in its primary and in its secondary aspect and in 
Whom this whole world comes together and dissolves—by 
truly realising Him Who 1s the Lord, the bestower of blessings, 
the Adorable God, one attains the supreme peace. 


12 


He, the creator of the gods and the bestower of their powers, 
the Support of the universe, Rudra the omniscient, who at the 
beginning gave birth to Hiranyagarbha—may He endow us 
with clear intellect! 


13 


He who is the sovereign of the gods, in whom the worlds find 
their support, who rules over all two—footed and four—footed 
beings—let us serve that God, radiant and blissful, with an 
oblation. 


14 
By realising Him who is subtler than the subtlest who dwells in 


the midst of the chaos, who is the Creator of all things and is 
endowed with many forms, who is the non—dual Pervader of 


 


the universe and all good—by realising Him one attains the 
supreme peace. 


15 


It is He who, in proper time, becomes the custodian of the 
universe and the sovereign of all; who conceals Himself in all 
beings as their inner Witness; and in whom the sages and the 
deities are united. Verily, by knowing Him one cuts asunder the 
fetters of death. 


16 


He who knows Brahman, who is all Bliss, extremely subtle, 
like the film that rises to the surface of clarified butter and is 
hidden in all beings—he who knows the radiant Deity, the sole 
Pervader of the universe, is released from all his fetters. 


17 


The Maker of all things, self—luminous and all—pervading, 
He dwells always in the hearts of men. He is revealed by the 
negative teachings of the Vedanta, discriminative wisdom and 
the Knowledge of Unity based upon reflection. They who know 
Him become immortal. 


18 


When there is no darkness of ignorance, there is no day or 
night, neither being nor non—being; the pure Brahman alone 
exists. That immutable Reality is the meaning of "That"; It is 
adored by the Sun. From It has proceeded the ancient wisdom. 


19 


No one can grasp Him above, across, or in the middle. There is 
no likeness of Him. His name is Great Glory (Mahad Yasah). 


20 

His form is not an object of vision; no one beholds Him with 
the eyes. They who, through pure intellect and the Knowledge 
of Unity based upon reflection, realise Him as abiding in the 
heart become immortal. 

21 

It is because Thou, O Lord, art birthless, that some rare souls, 


frightened by birth and death, take refuge in Thee. O Rudra, 
may Thy benign face protect me for ever! 


 


22 


O Rudra, do not, in Thy wrath, destroy our children and 
grand—children. Do not destroy our lives; do not destroy our 
cows or horses; do not destroy our strong servants. For we 
invoke Thee always, with oblations, for our protection. 


Chapter V 
1 


In the Immutable, infinite Supreme Brahman remain hidden the 
two: knowledge and ignorance. Ignorance leads to worldliness 
and knowledge, to Immortality. Brahman, who controls both 
knowledge and ignorance, is different from both. 


2 


He, the non—dual Brahman, who rules over every position; 
who controls all forms and all sources; who, in the beginning, 
filled with knowledge the omniscient Hiranyagarbha, His own 
creation, whom He beheld when He (Hiranyagarbha) was 
produced—He is other than both knowledge and ignorance. 


a 


At the time of the creation the Lord spreads out individual nets 
in various ways and then at the time of the cosmic dissolution 
withdraws them into the great prakriti. Again the all— 
pervading Deity creates the aggregates of body and senses, both 
individual and collective and their controllers also and thus 
exercises His overlordship. 


4 


As the sun shines, illumining all the quarters—above, below 
and across—so also God, self—tresplendent, adorable and 
non—dual, controls all objects, which themselves possess the 
nature of a cause. 


5—6 


He who is the cause of all and who enables all things to 
function according to their nature; who brings to maturity all 
that can be ripened; who, being non—dual, rules over the 
whole universe and engages the gunas in their respective 
functions—He is concealed in the Upanishads, the secret part 
of the Vedas. Brahma knew Him who can be known only from 
the evidence of the Vedas. The gods and seers of olden times 
who knew Him became Brahman and attained Immortality. 


 


a 


Endowed with gunas, the jiva performs action, seeking its fruit; 
and again, it reaps the fruit of what it has done. Assuming all 
forms and led by the three gunas, the jiva, ruler of the pranas, 
roams about following the three paths, according to its deeds. 


8 


Of the size of a thumb, but brilliant, like the sun, the jiva 
possesses both volition and egoism. It is endowed with the 
qualities of both buddhi and Atman. Therefore it is seen as 
another entity, inferior and small as the point of a goad. 


9 


Know the embodied soul to be a part of the hundredth part of 
the point of a hair divided a hundred times; and yet it is infinite. 


10 


It is not female, it is not male, nor is it neuter. whatever body it 
takes, with that it becomes united. 


11 


By means of desires, contact, attachment and delusion, the 
embodied soul assumes, successively, diverse forms in various 
places, according to its deeds, just as the body grows when 
food and drink are poured into it. 


12 


The embodied soul, by means of good and evil deeds 
committed by itself, assumes many forms, coarse and fine. By 
virtue of its actions and also of such characteristics of the mind 
as knowledge and desire, it assumes another body for the 
enjoyment of suitable objects. 


13 


He who knows the Lord, who is without beginning or end, who 
stands in the midst of the chaos of the world, who is the Creator 
of all things and is endowed with many forms—he who knows 
the radiant Deity, the sole Pervader of the universe, is released 
from all his fetters. 


 


14 


Those who know Him who can be realised by the pure heart, 
who is called incorporeal, who is the cause of creation and 
destruction, who is all good and the creator of the sixteen 
parts—those who know the luminous Lord are freed from 
embodiment. 


Chapter VI 
1 


Some learned men speak of the inherent nature of things and 
some speak of time, as the cause of the universe. They all, 
indeed, are deluded. It is the greatness of the self—luminous 
Lord that causes the Wheel of Brahman to revolve. 


2 


He by whom the whole universe is constantly pervaded is the 
Knower, the Author of time. He is sinless and omniscient, It is 
at His command that the work which is called earth, water, fire, 
air and akasa appears as the universe. All this should be 
reflected upon by the wise. 


3 


The yogi who first performs actions and then turns away from 
them and who practises one, two, three, or eight disciplines, 
unites one principle with another principle and with the help of 
virtues cultivated by the self and of subtle tendencies attains 
Liberation in course of time. 


4 


He who attains purity of heart by performing actions as an 
offering to the Lord and merges prakriti and all its effects in 
Brahman, realises his true Self and thereby transcends 
phenomena. In the absence of maya, both collective and 
individual, all his past actions are destroyed. After the 
destruction of the prarabdha karma he attains final Liberation. 


5 


The Great Lord is the beginning, the cause which unites the 
soul with the body; He is above the three kinds of time and is 
seen to be without parts. After having worshipped that adorable 
God dwelling in the heart, who is of many forms and is the true 
source of all things, man attains final Liberation. 


 


6 


He from whom this universe proceeds is higher and other than 
all forms of the Tree of the World and of time. When one 
knows Him who is the indweller, the bringer of good, the 
destroyer of evil, the Lord of powers, the immortal support of 
all, one attains final Liberation. 


7 


We know Him who is the Supreme Lord of lords, the Supreme 
Deity of deities, the Ruler of rulers; who is higher than the 
imperishable prakriti and is the self—luminous, adorable Lord 
of the world. 





8 


He is without a body or organs; none like unto Him is seen, or 
better than He. The Vedas speak of His exalted power, which is 
innate and capable of producing diverse effects and also of His 
omniscience and might. 


9 


He has no master in the world, no ruler, nor is there even a sign 
of Him by which He can be inferred. He is the cause, the Lord 
of the lord of the organs; and He is without progenitor or 
controller. 


10 


May the non—dual Lord, who, by the power of His maya, 
covered Himself, like a spider, with threads drawn from primal 
matter, merge us in Brahman! 


11 


The non—dual and resplendent Lord is hidden in all beings. 
All—pervading, the inmost Self of all creatures, the impeller to 
actions, abiding in all things, He is the Witness, the Animator 
and the Absolute, free from gunas. 


12 
There is a non—dual Ruler of the actionless many; He makes 


the one seed manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, 
who perceive Him within themselves—and not to others. 


 


13 


He is the Eternal among the eternal, the Conscious among the 
conscious and though non—dual, fulfils the desires of many. 
He who has known Him, the luminous Lord, the Great Cause, 
to be realised by Knowledge (Samkhya) and yoga, is freed 
from all fetters. 


14 


The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor 
these lightnings—much less this fire. He shining, everything 
shines after Him. By his light all this is lighted. 


15 


In this universe the Swan, the Supreme Self alone exists. It is 
He who, as fire, abides in the water. Only by knowing Him 
does one pass over death, There is no other way to reach the 
Supreme Goal. 


16 


He who is the support of both the unmanifested prakriti and the 
jiva, who is the Lord of the three gunas and who is the cause of 
bondage, existence and Liberation from samsara, is verily the 
Creator of the universe, the Knower, the inmost Self of all 
things and their Source—the omniscient Lord, the Author of 
time, the Possessor of virtues, the Knower of everything. 


17 


He who constantly rules the world is verily the cause of 
bondage and Liberation. Established in His own glory, He is 
the Immortal, the Embodiment of Consciousness, the 
omnipresent Protector of the universe. There is no one else able 
to rule it. 


18 

Seeking Liberation, I take refuge in the Lord, the revealer of 
Self—Knowledge, who in the beginning created Brahma and 
delivered the Vedas to Him. 

19—20 

When men shall roll up space as if it were a piece of hide, then 


there will be an end of misery without one's cultivating the 
Knowledge of the Lord, who is without parts, without actions, 


 


tranquil, blameless, unattached, the supreme bridge to 
Immortality, an like a fire that has consumed all its fuel. 


21 


Through the power of austerity and through the grace of the 
Lord, the sage Svetasvatara realised Brahman and proclaimed 
the highly sacred Knowledge, supremely cherished by the 
company of seers, to sannyasins of the most advanced stage. 


22 


The profound mystery in the Vedanta was taught in the 
previous cycle. It should not be given to one whose passions 
have not been subdued, nor to one who is not a son or a 
disciple. 


23 


If these truths have been told to a high—minded person who 
feels the highest devotion for God and for his guru as for God, 
then they will surely shine forth as inner experiences—then, 
indeed, they will shine forth. 


End of Svetasvatara Upanishad 
The Peace Chant 


Om. That is full; this is full. This fullness has been projected 
from that fullness. When this fullness merges in that fullness, 
all that remains is fullness. 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Invocation 


Om. May we, O gods, hear with our ears what is auspicious! 
May we, O worshipful gods, see with our eyes what is good! 
May we, strong in limbs and body, sing your praise and enjoy 
the life allotted to us by Prajapati! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Prasna Upanishad 


Question I 
1 


Om. Sukesa, the Son of Bharadvajaand Satyakama, the son of 
Sibiand Sauryayani, belonging to the family of Gargaand 
Kausalya, the son of Asvalaand Vaidarbhi, belonging to the 
family of Bhriguand Kahandhi, the Son of Katya—all these, 
devoted to Brahman and firm in Brahman and seeking the 
Supreme Brahman, approached, fuel in hand, the venerable 
Pippalada with the thought that he would tell them everything 
about Brahman. 


2 


The rishi said to them: Stay with me a year more, practising 
austerities, chastity and faith. Then you may ask questions 
according to your desire. If we know we shall tell you all. 


a 


Then Kabandhi, the son of Katya, came to him and asked: Sir, 
whence are these creatures born? 


4 


To him the teacher said: Prajapati, the Creator, was desirous of 
progeny. He performed austerities and having performed 
austerities, created the pair, the moon (rayi) and the sun 
(prana). He said to Himself: "These two should produce 
creatures for Me in manifold ways." 


5 


The sun is, indeed, prana, life; the moon is rayi, food. Food is, 
indeed, all this—what has form and what is formless. Therefore 
everything having form is, indeed, food. 


6 


Now the sun, when it rises, enters the eastern quarter and 
thereby enfolds the living beings of the east in its rays. And 
when it illuminates the southern, the western, the northern, the 
lower, the upper and the intermediate quarters—when it 
illuminates everything—it thus enfolds all living beings in its 
rays. 


 


7—8 


That sun rises every day—the sun, which is the soul of all 
creatures, the soul of all forms, which is life and fire. This has 
been described by the following rik: 

The wise know him who is in all forms, full of rays, all— 
knowing, non—dual, the support of all life, the eye of all 
beings, the giver of heat. There rises the sun, the thousand— 
rayed, existing in a hundred forms, the life of all creatures. 


9 


The year, verily, is Prajapati and there arc two paths thereof: 
the Southern and the Northern. Those who perform sacrifices 
and engage in pious actions, as duties to be done, win only the 
World of the Moon; verily they return hither again. Therefore 
the rishis who desire off—spring travel by the Southern Path. 
This Path of the Fathers is rayi, food. 


10 


But those who seek the Self through austerity, chastity, faith 
and knowledge travel by the Northern Path and win the Sun. 
The Sun, verily, is the support of all lives. He is immortal and 
fearless; He is the final goal. Thence they do not return. This 
path is blocked for the ignorant. Concerning it there is the 
following verse: 


11 


Some call Him the father with five feet and with twelve forms, 
the giver of rain and the dweller in the region above the sky. 
Others, again, say that the world is fixed in the omniscient Sun, 
endowed with seven wheels and six spokes. 


12 


The month, verily, is Prajapati. Its dark half, verily, is food, 
rayi; its bright half, the eater, prana. Therefore some rishis 
perform sacrifice in the bright half, some in the other half. 


13 
Day and night, verily, are Prajapati. Of these, day is the eater, 
prana and night, the food, rayi. Those who join in sexual 


enjoyment by day verily dissipate life; but to join in sexual 
enjoyment by night is, verily, chastity. 


 


14 


Food, verily, is Prajapati. From that comes semen; from semen 
are all these creatures born. 


15 


Those, therefore, who practise this rule of Prajapati beget a 
pair. But Brahmaloka belongs to those who observe austerity 
and chastity and in whom truth is firmly established. 


16 


The stainless World of Brahma belongs to those in whom there 
is no crookedness, no falsehood, no deception. 


Question II 


i 


Then Vaidarbhi, belonging to the family of Bhrigu, asked him: 
Sir, how many gods support the body of the created being? 
How many of these manifest their power through it? And which 
one, furthermore, is paramount? 


2 


To the disciple he said: Space, akasa, verily is that god—the 
wind, fire, water, earth, speech, mind, eye and ear, as well. 
These, having manifested their glory, said boastfully: "We 
support this body and uphold it." 


3 


To them prana, the chiefmost said: "Do not fall into delusion. I 
alone, dividing myself into five parts, support this body and 
uphold it." But they were incredulous. 


4 


Prana, out of pride, rose upward, as it were, from the body. 
Now, when it rose upward all the others rose upward also and 
when it settled down they all settled down with it. As bees go 
out when their queen goes out and return when she returns, 
even so did speech, mind, eye and ear. They, being satisfied, 
praised prana. 


 


5 


It burns as fire, it is the sun, it is the rain; it is Indra, it is the 
wind, it is the earth, it is food. It is the luminous god. It is being 
and non—being; it is immortality. 


6 


As spokes in the hub of a wheel, all are fixed in prana, 
including the Rig—Veda, the Yajur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, 
the kshattriyas and the brahmins. 


a 


As Prajapati thou movest about in the womb; it is thou, indeed, 
who art born again. To thee, O Prana, creatures bring offerings, 
to thee who dwellest in the body with the organs. 


8 


Thou art the chief bearer of oblations to the gods and the first 
offering to the departed fathers; thou art the true activities of 
the rishis, of the Atharvangiras. 


9 


Indra thou art, O Prana and Rudra, too, in prowess. Thou art the 
Protector. Thou movest in the sky; thou art the sun, the lord of 
lights. 


10 

When, O Prana, thou showerest down rain, these creatures of 
thine are delighted, thinking there will be as much food as they 
desire. 


11 


Thou art vratya, O Prana and the Ekarshi Fire that devours the 
butter. Thou art the Supreme Lord of all. We are the givers of 
the butter that thou consumest, O Matarisva! Thou art our 
father. 


12 
That form of thine which abides in speech, which abides in the 


ear, which abides in the eye and which pervades the mind, 
make propitious. Go not away! 


 


13 


All that exists here is under the control of prana and also what 
exists in heaven. Protect us as a mother her sons; bestow upon 
us prosperity and wisdom. 


Question ITI 


1 


Then Kausalya, the son of Asvala, asked Pippalada: Sir, 
whence is this prana born? How does it come into this body? 
How does it abide in the body after it has divided itself? How 
does it depart? How does it support the external and how the 
internal? 


2 


To him the teacher replied: You are asking difficult questions; 
you must be exceedingly devoted to Brahman. Therefore I will 
answer you. 


a 


This prana is born of Atman. As a shadow is cast by a person, 
so this prana is, by Atman. Through the activity of the mind it 
comes into this body. 


4 


As an emperor commands his officials, saying; "Rule these 
villages or those," so this prana employs the other pranas, each 
in its separate place. 


a 


Prana engages apana in the organs of excretion and generation; 
he himself moves through the mouth and nose and dwells in the 
eye and ear. In the middle is samana; it distributes equally what 
has been offered as food in the fire in the stomach. From this 
prana fire arise the seven flames. 


6 


The atman dwells in the heart, where there are one hundred and 
one arteries (nadi); for each of these there are one hundred 
branches and for each of these branches, again, there are 
seventy—two thousand subsidiary vessels. Vyana moves in 
these. 


 


7 


And then udana, ascending upward through one of them, 
conducts the departing soul to the virtuous world, for its 
virtuous deeds; to the sinful world, for its sinful deeds; and to 
the world of men, for both. 


8 


The sun, verily, is the external prana; for it rises, favouring the 
prana in the eye. The deity that exists in the earth controls the 
apana of man. The space, akasa, between heaven and earth is 
samana. The air is vyana. 


9 


Fire, verily, is udana; therefore he whose fire has been 
extinguished goes out for rebirth, with the senses absorbed in 
the mind. 


10 


Whatever one's thinking, with that one enters into prana. Prana 
joined with fire, together with the soul, leads to whatever world 
has been fashioned by thought. 


11 


The wise man who thus knows prana does not lose his 
offspring and becomes immortal. As to this there is the 
following verse: 


12 

He who knows the origin of prana, its entry, its place, its 
fivefold distribution, its internal aspect and also its external, 
obtains immortality; yea, he obtains immortality. 


Question IV 


1 


Next Sauryayani, belonging to the family of Garga, asked: Sir, 
what are they that sleep in man and what are they that remain 
awake in him? Which deity is it that sees dreams? Whose is the 
happiness? In whom, again, are all these gathered together? 


 


2 


To him Pippalada replied: O Gargya, as the rays of the sun, 
when it sets, are gathered in that luminous orb and again go 
forth when it rises, even so, verily, all these—the objects and 
the senses—become one in the superior god, the mind. 
Therefore at that time a man hears not, sees not, smells not, 
tastes not, touches not, speaks not, grasps not, enjoys not, emits 
not and does not move about. He sleeps—that is what people 
say. 


3 


The prana fires remain awake in this city. Apana is the 
Garhapatya Fire and vyana, the Anvaharyapachana Fire. And 
prana is the Ahavaniya Fire, so called from being taken—since 
it is taken from the Garhapatya Fire. 


4 


Samana is so called because it distributes equally the two 
oblations, namely, the out—breathing and the in—breathing; it 
is the priest. The mind, verily, is the sacrificer. Udana is the 
fruit of the sacrifice, because it leads the sacrificer every day, in 
deep sleep, to Brahman. 


5 


There, in dreams, that god, the mind, experiences glory. 
Whatever has been seen he sees again; whatever has been heard 
he hears again; whatever has been experienced in different 
countries and quarters, he experiences again. Whatever has 
been seen or not seen, heard or not heard and whatever is real 
or not real—he sees it all. He sees all, himself being all. 


6 


When the jiva is overcome by light he sees no dreams; at that 
time, in this body, arises this happiness. 


7—8 


As a bird goes to a tree to roost, even so, O friend, all this rests 
in the Supreme Atman: 

Earth and its subtle counterpart, water and its subtle 
counterpart, fire and its subtle counterpart, air and its subtle 
counterpart, akasa and its subtle counterpart, the eye and what 
can be seen, the ear and what can be heard, the nose and what 
can be smelt, the taste and what can be tasted, the skin and 
what can be touched, the organ of speech and what can be 


 


spoken, the hands and what can be grasped, the organ of 
generation and what can be enjoyed, the organ of excretion and 
what can be excreted, the feet and what is their destination, the 
mind (manas) and what can be thought, the intellect (buddhi) 
and what can be comprehended, the ego (ahamkara) and the 
object of egoism, the memory (chitta) and its object, knowledge 
(tejah) and its object, prana and what is to be supported. 


9 


He, verily, it is who sees, feels, hears, smells, tastes, thinks and 
knows. He is the doer, the intelligent self, the purusha. He is 
established in the Highest, the imperishable Atman. 


10 


He who knows that imperishable Being, bright, without 
shadow, without body, without colour, verily attains the 
Supreme, the undecaying Purusha, O my good friend, he who 
knows Atman becomes all—knowing, becomes all. About it 
there is the following verse: 


11 


He, O friend, who knows that imperishable Being wherein rests 
the intelligent self, together with the gods, the pranas and the 
elements—he becomes all—knowing and enters into all. 


Question V 


I 


Then Satyakama, the son of Sibi, asked Pippalada; Sir, if 
among men someone should here meditate on the syllable 
AUM until death, which world, verily, would he win thereby? 


2 

He replied: O Satyakama, the syllable AUM is the Supreme 
Brahman and also the other Brahman. Therefore he who knows 
it attains, with its support, the one or the other. 


3 


If he meditates on one letter (matra), then, being enlightened by 
that alone, he quickly comes back to earth after death. The rik 
verses lead him to the world of men. By practising austerity, 
chastity and faith he enjoys greatness. 


 


4 


If, again, he meditates on the second letter, he attains the mind 
and is led up by the yajur verses to the intermediate space, to 
the Plane of the Moon. Having enjoyed greatness in the Plane 
of the Moon, he returns hither again. 


5 


Again, he who meditates on the Highest Person through this 
syllable AUM consisting of three letters, becomes united with 
the effulgent Sun. As a snake is freed from its skin, even so he 
is freed from sin. 


6 


The three letters of AUM, if employed separately, are mortal; 
but when joined together in meditation on the total Reality and 
used properly on the activities of the external, internal and 
intermediate states, the knower trembles not. 


7 


The wise man, meditating on AUM, attains this world by 
means of the rik verses; the intermediate world by means of the 
yajur verses; and that which is known to the seers by means of 
the sama verses. And also through the syllable AUM he realises 
that which is tranquil, free from decay, death and fear and 
which is the Highest. 


Question VI 


: 


Then Sukesa, the son of Bharadvaja, said to Pippalada: Sir, 
Hiranyabha, the prince of Kosala, once came to me and asked 
this question: "O son of Bharadvaja, do you know the Person 
with sixteen parts?" I said to the prince: "I do not know Him; if 
I knew Him, why should I not tell you? Surely he who speaks 
what is not true withers away to the very root; therefore I 
should not speak untruth." Then he silently mounted his chariot 
and went away. Now I ask you: Where does that Person dwell? 


2 


Pippalada said to him: That Person—He from whom these 
sixteen parts arise—is verily here within the body. 


 


3 


The Purusha reflected: "What is it by whose departure I shall 
depart and by whose staying I shall stay?" 


4 


He created prana; from prana faith, space, air, fire, water, earth, 
the organs, mind, food; from food virility, austerity, the Vedic 
hymns, sacrifice, the worlds; and in the worlds He created 
names. 


5 


As these flowing rivers, bound for the ocean, disappear into the 
ocean after having reached it, their names and forms being 
destroyed and are called simply the ocean—even so, these 
sixteen parts of the seer, whose goal is the Purusha, disappear 
into the Purusha after having reached Him, their names and 
forms being destroyed and are called simply the Purusha. He 
becomes free of parts and immortal. 

On this there is the following verse: 


6 


Know Him, the Purusha, who alone is to he known and in 
whom the parts rest firm, like the spokes in the nave of a wheel, 
that death may not affect you. 


7 


Pippalada said to them: Thus far, indeed, I know the Supreme 
Brahman; there is nothing higher than this. 


8 


And they, worshipping him, said: Thou, indeed, art our 
father—thou who hast taken us across our ignorance to the 
other shore. 

Adoration to the supreme rishis! Adoration to the supreme 
rishis!

Mandukya Upanishad 


Chapter I — Agama Prakarana (The Chapter based on 
Vedic Testimony) 


I 


Harih Aum! AUM, the word, is all this, the whole universe. A 
clear explanation of it is as follows: All that is past, present and 
future is, indeed, AUM. And whatever else there is, beyond the 
threefold division of time—that also is truly AUM. 


Il 


All this is, indeed, Brahman. This Atman is Brahman. This 
same Atman has four quarters. 


Il 


The first quarter is called Vaisvanara, whose sphere of activity 
is the waking state, who is conscious of external objects, who 
has seven limbs and nineteen mouths and who is the 
experiencer of gross objects. 


IV 


The second quarter is Taijasa, whose sphere of activity is the 
dream state, who is conscious of internal objects, who is 
endowed with seven limbs and nineteen mouths and who is the 
experiencer of subtle objects. 


Vv 


That is the state of deep sleep wherein one asleep neither 
desires any object nor sees any dream. The third quarter is 
Prajna, whose sphere is deep sleep, in whom all experiences 
become unified, who is, verily, a mass of consciousness, who is 
full of bliss and experiences bliss and who is the door leading 
to the knowledge of dreaming and waking. 


VI 
He is the Lord of all. He is the knower of all. He is the inner 


controller. He is the source of all; for from him all beings 
originate and in him they finally disappear. 


 


Gaudapada Karika 
1 


Visva is all—pervading, the experiencer of external objects. 
Taijasa is the cognizer of internal objects. Prajna is a mass of 
consciousness. It is one alone that is thus known in the three 
states. 


2 


Visva is the cognizer through the right eye; Taijasa is the 
cognizer through the mind within; Prajna is the akasa in the 
heart. Therefore the one Atman is perceived threefold in the 
same body. 


34 


Visva experiences the gross; Taijasa, the subtle; and Prajna, the 
blissful. Know these to be the threefold experience. The gross 
object satisfies Visva; the subtle, Taijasa; and the blissful, 
Prajna. Know these to be the threefold satisfaction. 


2 


The experiencer and the objects of experience associated with 
the three states have been described. He who knows these both 
does not become attached to objects though enjoying them. 


6 


Surely a coming into existence must be predicated of all 
positive entities that exist. Prana manifests all inanimate 
objects. The Purusha manifests the conscious beings in their 
manifold forms. 


7 


Some of those who contemplate the process of creation regard 
it as the manifestation of God's powers; others imagine 
creation to be like dreams and illusions. 


8 


Those who are convinced about the reality of manifested 
objects ascribe the manifestation solely to God's will, while 
those who speculate about time regard time as the creator of 
things. 


 


9 


Some say that the manifestation is or the purpose of God's 
enjoyment, while others attribute it to His division. But it is the 
very nature of the effulgent Being. What desire is possible for 
Him who is the fulfillment of all desires? 


Vil 


Turiya is not that which is conscious of the inner (subjective) 
world, nor that which is conscious of the outer (objective) 
world, nor that which is conscious of both, nor that which is a 
mass of consciousness. It is not simple consciousness nor is It 
unconsciousness. It is unperceived, unrelated, 
incomprehensible, uninferable, unthinkable and indescribable. 
The essence of the Consciousness manifesting as the self in the 
three states, It is the cessation of all phenomena; It is all peace, 
all bliss and non—dual. This is what is known as the Fourth 
(Turiya). This is Atman and this has to be realized. 


10 


Turiya, the changeless Ruler, is capable of destroying all 
miseries. All other entities being unreal, the non—dual Turiya 
alone is known as effulgent and all—pervading. 


11 

Visva and Taijasa are conditioned by cause and effect. Prajna is 
conditioned by cause alone. Neither cause nor effect exists in 
Turiya. 


12 


Prajna does not know anything of self or non—self, of truth or 
untruth. But Turiya is ever existent and all—seeing. 


13 
Non—cognition of duality is common to both Prajna and 


Turiya. But Prajna is associated with sleep in the form of cause 
and this sleep does not exist in Turiya. 


 


14 


The first two, Visva and Taijasa, are associated with dreaming 
and sleep respectively; Prajna, with Sleep bereft of dreams. 
Knowers of Brahman see neither sleep nor dreams in Turtya. 


15 


Dreaming is the wrong cognition and sleep the non—cognition, 
of Reality. When the erroneous knowledge in these two is 
destroyed, Turiya is realized. 


16 


When the jiva, asleep under the influence of beginningless 
maya, is awakened, it then realizes birthless, sleepless and 
dreamless Non—duality. 


17 


If the phenomenal universe were real, then certainly it would 
disappear. The universe of duality which is cognized is mere 
illusion (maya); Non—duality alone is the Supreme Reality. 


18 


If anyone imagines illusory ideas such as the teacher, the taught 
and the scriptures, then they will disappear. These ideas are for 
the purpose of instruction. Duality ceases to exist when Reality 
is known. 


Vill 


The same Atman explained before as being endowed with four 
quarters is now described from the standpoint of the syllable 
AUM. AUM, too, divided into parts, is viewed from the 
standpoint of letters. The quarters of Atman are the same as the 
letters of AUM and the letters are the same as the quarters. The 
letters are A, U and M. 


IX 


Vaisvanara Atman, whose sphere of activity is the waking 
state, is A, the first letter of AUM, on account of his all— 
pervasiveness or on account of his being the first. He who 
knows this obtains all desires and becomes first among the 
great. 


 


xX 


Taijasa Atman, whose sphere of activity is the dream state, is 
U, the second letter of AUM, on account of his superiority or 
intermediateness. He who knows this attains a superior 
knowledge, receives equal treatment from all and finds in his 
family no one ignorant of Brahman. 


XI 


Prajna Atman, whose sphere is deep sleep, is M, the third letter 
of AUM, because both are the measure and also because in 
them all become one. He who knows this is able to measure all 
and also comprehends all within himself. 


19 


When it is desired to describe the identity of Visva and the 
letter A, the chief ground given is the fact that each is the first 
in its respective sphere. Another reason for this identity is the 
all—pervasiveness of each. 


20 


The clear ground for realizing Taijasa as of the same nature as 
the letter U is the common feature of superiority. Another plain 
reason for such identity is their being in the middle. 


21 


The indisputable reason given for the identity of Prajna and M 
is the common feature that both are the measure. The other 
reason for such identity is another common feature, namely, 
that both represent the state of mergence. 


22 

He who knows for certain the similarity of the three states and 
the three letters of AUM, based upon their common features, is 
worshipped and adored by all beings and also is a great sage. 
23 

Through meditation on A the seeker attains Visva; through 


meditation on U, Taijasa; and through meditation on M, Prajna. 
Meditation on the "soundless" brings no attainment. 


 


XII 


The Fourth (Turtya) is without parts and without relationship; It 
is the cessation of phenomena; It is all good and non—dual. 
This AUM is verily Atman. He who knows this merges his self 
in Atman—yea, he who knows this. 


End of Mandukya Upanishad 


24 


AUM should be known quarter by quarter. There is no doubt 
that the quarters are the same as the letters. Having understood 
AUM quarter by quarter, one should not think of anything else. 


25 


The mind should be concentrated on AUM. AUM is the 
fearless Brahman. He who is always absorbed in AUM knows 
no fear whatever. 


26 


AUM is verily the Lower Brahman. It is also stated to be the 
Higher Brahman. AUM is beginningless and unique. There is 
nothing outside it. It is unrelated to any effect and is 
immutable. 


27 


AUM is, indeed, the beginning, middle and end of all things. 
He who has realized AUM as immutable immediately attains 
the Supreme Reality. 


28 

Know AUM to be Isvara, ever present in the hearts of all. The 
calm soul, contemplating AUM as all—pervading, does not 
grieve. 

29 

One who knows AUM, which is soundless and also endowed 


with infinite sounds, which is all good and the negation of 
duality, is a real sage and none other. 


: 


Chapter Il — Vaitathya Prakarana (The Chapter on 
Illusion) 


1 


Harih Aum. The wise declare the unreality of all entities seen in 
dreams, because they are located within the body and the space 
therein is confined. 


2 


The dreamer, on account of the shortness of the time involved, 
cannot go out of the body and see the dream objects. Nor does 
he, when awakened, find himself in the places seen in the 
dream. 


3 


Scripture, on rational grounds, declares the non—existence of 
the chariots etc. perceived in dreams. Therefore the wise say 
that the unreality established by reason is proclaimed by 
scripture. 


4 


The different objects seen in the confined space of dreams are 
unreal on account of their being perceived. For the same reason 
i.e. on account of their being perceived, the objects seen in the 
waking state are also unreal. The same condition i.e. the state of 
being perceived exists in both waking and dreaming. The only 
difference is the limitation of space associated with dream 
objects. 


2 


Thoughtful persons speak of the sameness of the waking and 
dream states on account of the similarity of the objects 
perceived in both states on the grounds already mentioned. 


6 


If a thing is non—existent both in the beginning and in the end, 
it is necessarily non—existent in the present. The objects that 
we see are really like illusions; still they are regarded as real. 


7 
The utility of the objects of waking experience is contradicted 


in dreams; therefore they are certainly unreal. Thus both 
experiences, having a beginning and an end, are unreal. 


 


8 


The objects perceived by the dreamer, not usually seen in the 
waking state, owe their existence to the peculiar conditions 
under which the cognizer i.e. the mind functions for the time 
being, as with those residing in heaven. The dreamer, 
associating himself with the dream conditions, perceives those 
objects, even as a man, well instructed here, goes from one 
place to another and sees the peculiar objects belonging to 
those places. 


9—10 


In dreams, what is imagined within the mind is illusory and 
what is cognized outside by the mind, real; but truly, both are 
known to be unreal. Similarly, in the waking state, what is 
imagined within by the mind is illusory and what is cognized 
outside by the mind, real; but both should be held, on rational 
grounds, to be unreal. 


11 


If the objects perceived in both waking and dreaming are 
illusory, who perceives all these objects and who, again, 
imagines them? 


12 


It is the self—luminous Atman who, through the power of Its 
own maya, imagines in Itself by Itself all the objects that the 
subject experiences within and without. It alone is the cognizer 
of objects. This is the decision of Vedanta. 


13 


The Lord (Atman), with His mind turned outward, imagines in 
diverse forms various objects either permanent, such as the 
earth, or impermanent, such as lightning, which are already in 
His mind in the form of vasanas, or desires. Again, He turns 
His mind within and imagines various ideas. 


14 
Those that are cognized internally only as long as the thought 
of them lasts and those that are perceived outside and relate to 


two points in time, are all mere objects of the imagination. 
There is no ground for differentiating the one from the other. 


 


15 


Those that exist within the mind as subjective ideas and are 
known as unmanifested and those that are perceived to exist 
outside in a manifested form, both are mere objects of the 
imagination. Their difference lies only in the difference of the 
organs by means of which they are perceived. 


16 


First of all is imagined the jiva, the embodied individual and 
then are imagined the various entities, both external such as 
sounds, forms, etc. and internal such as the pranas, sense— 
organs, etc., that are perceived to exist. As is one's knowledge 
so is one's memory. 


17 


As a rope lying in darkness, about whose nature one remains 
uncertain, is imagined to be a snake or a line of water, so 
Atman is imagined in various ways. 


18 


When the real nature of the rope is ascertained, all 
misconceptions about it disappear and there arises the 
conviction that it is nothing but a rope. Even so is the true 
nature of Atman determined. 


19 


Atman is imagined as prana and other numberless ideas. All 
this is due to maya, belonging to the effulgent Atman, by which 
It appears, Itself, to be deluded. 


20 


Those conversant with prana describe Atman as prana; those 
conversant with the elements, as the elements; those conversant 
with the gunas, as the gunas; and those conversant with the 
tattvas, as the tattvas. 


21 
Those acquainted with the padas call It the padas; those 


acquainted with objects, the objects; those acquainted with the 
lokas, the lokas; those acquainted with the gods, the gods. 


 


22 


Those conversant with the Vedas describe Atman as the Vedas; 
those conversant with the sacrifices, as the sacrifices; those 
conversant with the enjoyer, as the enjoyer; and those 
conversant with the objects of enjoyment call It the objects of 
enjoyment. 


23 


The knowers of the subtle call It the subtle and the knowers of 
the gross, the gross. Those that are familiar with the Personal 
Deity call It the Personal Deity and those that are familiar with 
the void, the void. 


24 


Those that know time call Atman time and those that know 
space call It space. Those versed in the art of disputation call It 
the object of dispute; and those knowing the worlds call It the 
worlds. 


25 


The knowers of the mind call Atman the mind; the knowers of 
the buddhi, the buddhi. The knowers of the chitta call It the 
chitta; and the knowers of righteousness and unrighteousness 
call It righteousness and unrighteousness. 


26 


Some say that Atman consists of twenty—five cosmic 
principles; some, of twenty—six principles; some, again, of 
thirty—one principles; while there are yet others who describe 
It as consisting of an infinite number of principles. 


27 


Those who know how to gratify others call Atman gratification; 
those who are conversant with the asramas call It the asramas. 
The grammarians call It the masculine, feminine and neuter 
genders; and still others, the Higher Brahman and the Lower 
Brahman. 


28 
The knowers of creation call It creation; the knowers of 
dissolution, dissolution; and the knowers of preservation, 


preservation. In truth, all such ideas are always imagined in 
Atman. 


 


29 


The disciple grasps only that idea which is presented to him by 
his teacher. Atman assumes the form of what is taught and thus 
protects the disciple. Absorbed in that idea, he realizes it as 
Atman. 


30 


Atman, though non—separate from all these ideas, appears to 
he separate. He who truly knows this interprets, without any 
fear, the meaning of the Vedas. 


31 


As dreams, illusions and castles in the air are viewed, so is the 
tangible universe viewed by the wise, well versed in Vedanta. 


32 


There is neither dissolution nor creation, none in bondage and 
none practicing disciplines. There is none seeking Liberation 
and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. 


33 


Atman is imagined as the unreal objects that are perceived to 
exist and as Non—duality as well. The objects, too, are 
imagined in the non—dual Atman. Therefore Non—duality is 
Bliss. 


34 


The diversity in the universe does not exist as an entity 
identical With Atman, nor does it exist by itself. Neither is it 
separate from Brahman nor is it non—separate. This is the 
statement of the wise. 


35 


The wise, who are free from attachment, fear and anger and are 
well versed in the Vedas, have realized Atman as devoid of all 
phantasms and free from the illusion of the manifold and as 
non—dual. 


36 
Therefore, knowing Atman as such, fix your attention on 


Non—duality. Having realized Non—duality, behave in the 
world like an inert object. 


 


37 


The illumined sannyasin does not praise any deity, does not 
salute any superior and does not perform rites to propitiate 
departed ancestors. Regarding both body and Atman as his 
abode, he remains satisfied with what comes by chance. 


38 


Having known the truth regarding what exists internally as also 
the truth regarding what exists externally, he becomes one with 
Reality, he exults in Reality and never deviates from Reality. 


Chapter III — Adavaita Prakarana — (The Chapter on 
Non—duality) 


1 


The jiva, betaking himself to devotional worship, abides in the 
manifest Brahman. He thinks that before the creation all was of 
the same nature as the birthless Reality. Therefore he is said to 
possess a narrow intellect. 


2 


Therefore I shall now describe Brahman, which is unborn, the 
same throughout and free from narrowness. From this one can 
understand that Brahman does not in reality pass into birth even 
in the slightest degree, though It appears to be manifest 
everywhere. 


a 


Atman, which is like akasa (infinite space), is said to be 
manifested in the form of jivas, which may be likened to the 
akasas enclosed in pots. The bodies, also, are said to be 
manifested from Atman, just as a pot and the like are created 
out of akasa. As regards the manifestation of Atman this is the 
illustration. 


4 


As, on the destruction of the pot etc., the akasa enclosed in 
them merge in the great akasa, so the jivas merge in Atman. 


5 


As the dust, smoke, etc. soiling the akasa enclosed in a 
particular pot do not soil the other akasas enclosed in other 


 


pots, so also the happiness, miseries, etc. of one jiva do not 
affect other jivas. 


6 


Though the diversity of forms, functions and names of the 
akasas associated with different receptacles is admitted, yet this 
does not imply any real differentiation in akasa itself. The same 
is the conclusion regarding the jivas. 


7 


As the akasa enclosed in a pot is neither an effect nor a part of 
the real akasa, so the jiva is neither an effect nor a part of 
atman. 


8 


Children regard akasa as being soiled by dirt; likewise the 
ignorant regard Atman as being similarly soiled. 


9 


Atman, in regard to Its birth and death, Its going and coming 
i.e. rebirth and Its dwelling in different bodies, is not unlike 
akasa. 


10 


All aggregates are produced by Atman's maya, as in a dream. 
No rational argument can be given to establish their reality, 
whether they are of equal status or whether some are superior 
to others. 


11 


The Supreme Self is the self of the five sheaths, such as the 
physical and the vital, which have been described in the 
Taittiriya Upanishad. That the Supreme Self is like akasa has 
already been stated. 


12 
The same akasa dwells within both the earth and the stomach; 


likewise, the same Brahman dwells within the pairs described 
in the Madhu—Brahmana. 


 


13 


The identity of the jiva and Atman is praised by pointing out 
their non—duality; multiplicity is condemned. Therefore non— 
dualism alone is free from error. 


14 


The separateness of the jiva and Atman, which has been 
declared in the earlier section of the Upanishads, dealing with 
the creation, is figurative, because this section states only what 
will happen in the future. This separateness cannot be the real 
meaning of those passages. 


15 


The scriptural statements regarding the creation, using the 
examples of earth, iron and sparks, are for the purpose of 
clarifying the mind. Multiplicity does not really exist in any 
manner. 


16 


There are three stages of life, corresponding to the threefold 
understanding of men: inferior, mediocre and superior. 
Scripture, out of compassion, has taught this discipline for the 
benefit of the unenlightened. 


17 


The dualists, firmly clinging to their conclusions, contradict 
one another. The non—dualists find no conflict with them. 


18 


Since Non—duality is Ultimate Reality, duality is said to be Its 
effect. The dualist sees duality in both the Absolute and the 
relative. Therefore the non—dualist position does not conflict 
with the dualist position. 


19 
The unborn Atman becomes manifold through maya and not 


otherwise. For if the manifold were real, then the immortal 
would become mortal. 


 


20 


The disputants assert that the unborn entity (Atman) becomes 
born. Now can one expect that an entity that is birthless and 
immortal should become mortal? 


21 


The immortal cannot become mortal, nor can the mortal 
become immortal. For it is never possible for a thing to change 
its nature. 


22 


How can one who believes that an entity by nature immortal 
becomes mortal, maintain that the immortal, after passing 
through change, retains its changeless nature? 


23 


Corning into birth may be real or illusory; both views are 
equally supported by the scriptures. But that view which is 
supported by the scriptures and corroborated by reason is alone 
to be accepted and not the other. 


24 


From such scriptural passages as, "One does not see any 
multiplicity in Atman" and "Indra (the Supreme Lord), through 
maya, assumes diverse forms", one knows that Atman, though 
ever unborn, appears to have become many only through maya. 


25 


Further, by the negation of the creation, coming into birth is 
negated. The causality of Brahman is denied by such a 
statement as "Who can cause It to come into birth?" 


26 


On account of the incomprehensible nature of Atman, the 
scriptural passage "Not this, not this" negates all dualistic ideas 
attributed to Atman. Therefore the birthless Atman alone exists. 


27 
What is ever existent appears to pass into birth through maya, 
yet from the standpoint of Reality it does not do so. But he who 


thinks this passing into birth is real asserts, as a matter of fact, 
that what is born passes into birth again. 


 


28 


The unreal cannot be born either really or through maya. For it 
is not possible for the son of a barren woman to be born either 
really or through maya. 


29 


As in dreams the mind acts through maya, presenting the 
appearance of duality, so also in the waking state the mind acts 
through maya, presenting the appearance of duality. 


30 


There is no doubt that the mind, which is in reality non—dual, 
appears to be dual in dreams; likewise, there is no doubt that 
what is non—dual, i.e. Atman, appears to be dual in the waking 
State. 


31 


All the multiple objects, comprising the movable and the 
immovable, are perceived by the mind alone. For duality is 
never perceived when the mind ceases to act. 


32 


When the mind, after realizing the knowledge that Atman alone 
is real, becomes free from imaginations and therefore does not 
cognize anything, for want of objects to he cognized, it ceases 
to be the mind. 


33 


Knowledge (Jnana), which is unborn and free from 
imagination, is described by the wise as ever inseparable from 
the knowable. The immutable and birthless Brahman is the goal 
of knowledge. The birthless is known by the birthless. 


34 
One should know the behavior of the mind which, being 
endowed with discrimination and free from illusions is under 


control. The condition of the mind in deep sleep is not like that 
but is of a different kind. 


 


35 


The mind is withdrawn in deep sleep, but it is not so when the 
mind is controlled. The controlled mind is verily the fearless 
Brahman, the light of whose omniscience is all—pervading. 


36 


Brahman is birthless, sleepless, dreamless, nameless and 
formless. It is ever effulgent and omniscient. No duty, in any 
sense, can ever be associated with It. 


aT 


Atman is beyond all expression by words and beyond all acts of 
the mind. It is great peace, eternal effulgence and samadhi; It is 
unmoving and fearless. 


38 


Brahman is free from mental activity and hence from all ideas 
of acceptance or relinquishment. When knowledge is 
established in Atman it attains birthlessness and sameness. 


39 


This yoga, which is not in touch with anything, is hard for 
yogis in general to attain. They are afraid of it, because they see 
fear in that which is really fearlessness. 


40 


Yogis who are ignorant of Non—duality depend on the control 
of the mind for attaining fearlessness, the destruction of misery, 
Self—Knowledge and imperishable peace. 


41 


The mind is to be brought under Control by undepressed effort; 
it is like emptying the ocean, drop by drop, with the help of a 
blade of kusa grass. 


42 
The mind distracted by desires and enjoyments should he 
brought under control by proper means; so also the mind 


enjoying pleasure in inactivity (laya). For the state of inactivity 
is as harmful as the state of desires. 


 


43 


Turn back the mind from the enjoyment of desires, 
remembering that they beget only misery. Do not see the 
created objects, remembering that all this is the unborn Atman. 


44 


If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, 
make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it 
contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained 
sameness, do not disturb it again. 


45 


The yogi must not taste the happiness arising from samadhi; he 
should detach himself from it by the exercise of discrimination. 
If his mind, after attaining steadiness, again seeks external 

objects, he should make it one with Atman through great effort. 


46 


When the mind does not lapse into inactivity and is not 
distracted by desires, that is to say, when it remains unshakable 
and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes 
Brahman. 


47 


This Supreme Bliss abides in the Self. It is peace; it is 
Liberation; it is birthless and cannot be described in words. It is 
called the omniscient Brahman, being one with the birthless 
Self, which is the true object of knowledge. 


48 


No jiva ever comes into existence. There exists no cause that 
can produce it. The supreme truth is that nothing ever is born. 


Chapter IV — Alatasanti Prakarana (The Chapter on the 
Quenching of the Fire—brand) 


1 
I bow to the best among men, who, by means of knowledge, 
which is like akasa and which is non—different from the goal 


of knowledge, realized the nature of the jivas (dharmas), which, 
too, are like akasa. 


 


2 


I bow to the yoga known as asparsa, taught in the scriptures, 
which promotes the happiness and well—being of all creatures 
and is free from strife and contradictions. 


3 


Some disputants postulate that only an existing entity can again 
come into existence, while other disputants, proud of their 
intellect, postulate that only a non—existing entity can come 
into existence. Thus they quarrel among themselves. 


4 


An existing entity cannot again come into existence (birth); nor 
can a non—existing entity come into existence. Thus disputing 
among themselves, they really establish the non—dualistic 
view of ajati (non—creation). 


5 


We approve the ajati (non—creation) thus established by them. 
We have no quarrel with them. Now hear from us about 
Ultimate Reality, which is free from all disputations. 


6—8 


The disputants assert that the unborn entity (Atman) becomes 
born. How can one expect that an entity that is birthless and 
immortal should become mortal? 

The immortal cannot become mortal, nor can the mortal 
become immortal. For it is never possible for a thing to change 
its nature. 

How can one who believes that an entity by nature immortal 
becomes mortal, maintain that the immortal, after passing 
through change, retains its changeless nature? 


9 


By the prakriti, or nature, of a thing is understood that which, 
when acquired, becomes the essential part of the thing, that 
which is its characteristic quality, that which is its inalienable 
nature from its very birth, that which is not extraneous to it and 
that which never ceases to be itself. 


10 


All the jivas are, by their very nature, free from senility and 
death. But they think they are subject to senility and death and 


 


by the very power of thought they appear to deviate from their 
true nature. 


11 


The disputant according to whom the cause itself is the effect 
must maintain that the cause is born as the effect. If it is born, 
how can it be called birthless? If it is subject to modification, 
how then can it be said to be eternal? 


12 


If, as you say, the effect is non—different from the cause, then 
the effect too must be unborn. Further, how can the cause be 
eternal if it is non—different from the effect, which is born? 


13 


There is no illustration to support the view that the effect is 
born from an unborn cause. Again, if it is said that the effect is 
produced from a cause which itself is born, then this leads to an 
infinite regress. 


14 


How can they who assert that the effect is the cause of the 
cause and the cause is the cause of the effect, maintain the 
beginninglessness of both cause and effect? 


15 


Those who say that the effect is the cause of the cause and that 
the cause is the cause of the effect maintain, actually, that the 
creation takes place after the manner of the birth of father from 
son. 


16 


If causality is asserted, then the order in which cause and effect 
succeed each other must be stated. If it is said that they appear 
simultaneously, then, being like the two horns of an animal, 
they cannot be mutually related as cause and effect. 


17 
The cause that you affirm, cannot be established as the cause if 


it is produced from the effect. How can the cause, which itself 
is not established, give birth to the effect? 


 


18 


If the cause is produced from the effect and if the effect is, 
again, produced from the cause, which of the two is born first 
upon which depends the birth of the other? 


19 


The inability to reply to the question raised above, the 
ignorance about the matter and the impossibility of establishing 
the order of succession if the causal relation is admitted clearly 
lead the wise to uphold, under all conditions, the doctrine of 
ajati, or non—creation. 


20 


The illustration of the seed and the sprout is something which is 
yet to be proved. The illustration i.e. the middle term, which 
itself is not yet proved, cannot be used for establishing a 
proposition to be proved. 


21 


The ignorance regarding the antecedence and the subsequence 
of cause and effect clearly proves the absence of creation 
(ajati). If the jiva (dharma) has really been horn, then why can 
you not point out its antecedent cause? 


22 


Nothing whatsoever is born, either of itself or of another entity. 
Nothing is ever produced, whether it be being or non—being or 
both being and non—being. 


23 


The cause cannot be produced from a beginningless effect; nor 
can the effect be produced from a beginningless cause. That 
which is without beginning is necessarily free from birth. 


24 
Subjective knowledge must have an object for its cause; 
otherwise variety becomes non—existent. Further, from the 


experience of pain, the existence of external objects, accepted 
by the dualistic scriptures, must be admitted. 


 


25 


The dualists, by force of reason, assert that there is a cause of 
subjective knowledge. But from the standpoint of the true 
nature of things we assert that the so—called cause is, after all, 
no cause. 


26 


The mind is not related to external objects or to the ideas that 
appear as such objects. This is so because objects are non— 
existent and the ideas that appear as external objects are not 
distinct from the mind. 


27 


The mind does not enter into the causal relation in any of the 
three periods of time. How can it ever be subject to delusion, 
when there is no cause for such delusion? 


28 


Therefore neither the mind nor the objects perceived by the 
mind are ever born. To see their birth is like seeing the 
footprints of birds in the sky. 


29 


The cause, Brahman, from which the birthless mind is asserted, 
by the dualists, to have been born is itself unborn. Because 
Brahman is ever unborn, therefore it is never possible for It to 
be other than what It is. 


30 


If, as the dualists contend, the world is beginningless, then it 
cannot be non—eternal. Moksha (Liberation) cannot have a 
beginning and be eternal. 


31—32 


If a thing is non—existent in the beginning and in the end, it is 
necessarily non—existent in the present. The objects that we 
see are really like illusions; still they are regarded as real. 

The utility of the objects of waking experience is contradicted 
in dreams; therefore they are certainly unreal. Both experiences 
have a beginning and an end. 


 


33 


All entities seen in dreams are unreal, because they are 
perceived inside the body. How is it possible for things that are 
perceived to exist, really to exist in Brahman, which is 
indivisible and homogeneous? 


34 


It is not reasonable to think that a dreamer actually goes out in 
order to experience the objects seen in the dream, because of 
the discrepancy of the time involved in such a journey. Nor 
does he, when awakened, find himself in the places seen in the 
dream. 


35 


The dreamer, after awaking, realizes the illusoriness of the 
conversations he had with friends etc. in the dream state. 
Further, he does not possess in the waking state anything he 
acquired while dreaming. 


36 


The dream body is unsubstantial because the other i.e. the 
physical body, different from it, is perceived. Like the dream 
body, all things cognized by the mind are unsubstantial. 


a7 


Since the experience of objects in dreams is similar to the 
experience of objects in the waking state, waking experience is 
regarded as the cause of dream experience. It is only by him 
who admits waking experience to be the cause of dream 
experience that waking experience can be regarded as real. 


38 


All entities are said to be unborn, since birth cannot be 
established as a fact. It is utterly impossible for the unreal to be 
born of the real. 


39 
A man filled with the impressions of the unreal objects seen in 
the waking state sees those very things in dreams as well. But 


he does not see in the waking state the unreal objects seen in 
dreams. 


 


40 


The unreal cannot have another unreality for its cause, nor can 
the real have the unreal for its cause. The real cannot be the 
cause of the real. And how utterly impossible it is for the real to 
be the cause of the unreal! 


41 


As a person in the waking state through false knowledge 
appears to handle objects, whose nature is inscrutable, as if they 
were real, so also, in dreams, he perceives, through false 
knowledge, objects whose existence is possible in the dream 
state alone. 


42 


Wise men teach causality only for the sake of those who, afraid 
of non—creation, assert the reality of external objects because 
they perceive such objects and also because they cling to 
various social and religious duties. 


43 


Those who, because of their fear of the truth of absolute non— 
creation and also because of their perception of external 
objects, deny ajati (non—creation) are not affected by the evil 
consequent on the belief in creation. This evil, if there is any, is 
insignificant. 


4 


As an elephant conjured up by a magician is taken to be real 
because it is perceived to exist and also because it answers to 
the behavior of a real elephant, so also external objects are 
taken to be real because they are perceived to exist and because 
one can deal with them. 


45 


It is Consciousness, Vijnana, alone that appears to be born or to 
move or to take the form of matter. But this Consciousness is 
really ever unborn, immovable and free from the traits of 
materiality; it is all peace and non—dual. 


46 
Thus the mind is never subject to birth. All beings, too, are free 


from birth. Those who know this do not fall into false 
knowledge. 


 


47 


As the line made by a moving fire—brand appears to be 
straight, crooked, etc., so Consciousness, when set in motion, 
appears as the perceiver, the perceived and the like. 


48 


As the fire—brand, when not in motion, is free from all 
appearances and remains changeless, so Consciousness, when 
not in motion, is free from all appearances and remains 
Changeless. 


49 


When the fire—brand is set in motion, the appearances that are 
seen in it do not come from elsewhere. When it is still, the 
appearances do not leave the motionless fire—brand and go 
elsewhere, nor do they enter into the fire—brand itself. 


50 


The appearances do not emerge from the fire—brand, because 
their nature is not that of a substance. This applies likewise to 
Consciousness, because of the similarity of the appearances. 


51—52 


When Consciousness is associated with the idea of activity, as 
in the waking and dream states, the appearances that seem to 
arise do not come from anywhere else. When Consciousness is 
non—active, as in deep sleep, the appearances do not leave the 
non—active Consciousness and go elsewhere, nor do they 
merge in it. The appearances do not emerge from 
Consciousness, for their nature is not that of a substance. They 
are incomprehensible, because they are not subject to the 
relation of cause and effect. 


53 


A substance may be the cause of another substance and a non— 
substance, the cause of another non—substance. But the jivas 
cannot possibly be anything like a substance or a non— 
substance. 


54 
Thus external appearances (objects) are not caused by the mind, 


nor is the mind caused by them. Hence thoughtful people hold 
to the principle of absolute non—creation. 

 


55 


As long as a person clings to the belief in causality, he will find 
cause producing effect. But when this attachment to causality 
wears away, cause and effect become non—existent. 


56 


As long as a person clings to the belief in causality, samsara 
will continue to expand for him. But when this attachment to 
causality wears away, samsara becomes non—existent. 


a7 


The entire universe is created by false knowledge; therefore 
nothing in it is eternal. Everything, again, as one with Ultimate 
Reality, is unborn; therefore there is no such thing as 
destruction. 


58 


Birth is ascribed to the jivas; but such birth is not possible from 
the standpoint of Reality. Their birth is like that of an illusory 
object. That illusion, again, does not exist. 


59 


The illusory sprout is born of the illusory seed. This illusory 
sprout is neither permanent nor destructible. The same applies 
to the jivas. 


60 


The term permanent or impermanent cannot be applied to the 
birthless jivas. What is indescribable in words cannot be 
discriminated about as permanent or impermanent. 


61—62 


As in dreams the mind acts through maya, presenting the 
appearance of duality, so also in the waking state the mind acts 
through maya, presenting the appearance of duality. 

There is no doubt that the mind, which is in reality non—dual, 
appears to be dual in dreams; likewise, there is no doubt that 
what is non—dual i.e. Atman, appears to be dual in the waking 
state. 


 


63 


The dreamer, wandering about in all the ten directions in his 
dream, sees the whole variety of jivas, born of eggs, moisture, 
ete. 


64 


These entities, which are objects of the mind of the dreamer, do 
not exist apart from his mind. Likewise, the mind of the 
dreamer is an object of perception of the dreamer alone. 


65—66 


The waking man, wandering about in all the ten directions in 
his waking state, sees the whole variety of jivas, born of eggs, 
moisture, etc. They are the objects of the mind of the waking 
man and do not exist apart from it. Likewise, the mind of the 
waking man is an object of his perception alone. 


67 


Both the mind and the jivas are objects of each other's 
perception. Can the one exist independent of the other? The 
reply of the wise is in the negative. There is no evidence of the 
existence of the one without the other; they are cognized only 
through each other. 


68—70 


As the dream jiva comes into existence and disappears, so also 
these jivas perceived in the waking state appear and disappear. 
As the jiva conjured up by the magician comes into existence 
and disappears, so also these jivas perceived in the waking state 
appear and disappear. 

As an artificial jiva comes into existence and disappears, so 
also these jivas perceived in the waking state appear and 
disappear. 


71 


No jiva ever comes into existence. There exists no cause that 
can produce it. The supreme truth is that nothing ever is born. 


72 
The world of duality, which is perceived to exist and is 


characterized by the subject—object relationship, is verily a 
movement of the mind. The mind, again, from the standpoint of 


 


Reality has no contact with any object. Hence it is declared to 
be eternal and unattached. 


73 


That which exists on the strength of false knowledge based 
upon imagination does not really exist. Again, that which is 
said to exist on the strength of the views advanced by other 
schools of thought does not really exist. 


74 


Atman is called birthless (aja) from the standpoint of false 
knowledge based upon imagination; in reality It is not even 
birthless. The unborn Atman is said to be born from the 
standpoint of the false knowledge cherished by other schools of 
thought. 


i 


People persistently hold to the idea of unreality i.e. duality. But 
such duality does not exist. One who has realized the absence 
of duality is not born again, since there remains no longer any 
cause for his birth. 


76 


When the mind finds no cause—superior, inferior, or 
middling—it becomes free from birth. How can there be an 
effect without a cause? 


77 


The birthlessness of the mind, which is free from manifestation 
and causal relationship, is absolute and constant. For duality i.e. 
the perceiving mind and its objects is merely an objectification 
of the mind. 


78 

Realizing the absence of causality as ultimate truth and not 
finding any other reason for birth, one attains that state which is 
free from grief, desire and fear. 

79 

On account of attachment to unreal objects the mind pursues 


such objects. But it comes back to its pure state when it attains 
non—attachment, realizing their unreality. 


 


80 


The mind freed from attachment to all external objects and 
undistracted by fresh objects attains the state of immutability. 
The wise realize such a mind to be Brahman; It is 
undifferentiated, birthless and non—dual. 

The birthless, dreamless and sleepless Reality reveals Itself by 
Itself; for this Dharma (Atman) by Its very nature is self— 
luminous. 


82 


The Lord (Atman) becomes easily hidden because of 
attachment to any single object and is revealed with great 
difficulty. 


83 


The ignorant, with their childish minds, verily cover Atman by 
predicating of It such attributes as existence, non—existence, 
existence and non—existence and total non—existence, 
deriving these characteristics from the notions of change, 
immovability, combination of change and immovability and 
absolute negation which they associate with Atman. 


84 


These are the four theories regarding Atman, through 
attachment to which It always remains hidden from one's view. 
He who knows the Lord to he ever untouched by them indeed 
knows all. 


85 

What else remains to be desired by him who has attained the 
state of the brahmin—a state of complete omniscience and 
non—duality, which is without beginning, middle, or end? 
86 

The humility (vinaya) of the brahmins is natural. Their 
tranquility (sama) is also natural. Further, the control of the 


senses (dama) comes natural to them. He who has realized 
Brahman attains peace. 


 


87 


Vedanta recognizes the ordinary state of waking, in which 
duality, consisting of objects and the idea of coming in contact 
with them, is admitted. It also recognizes a purer ordinary state 
i.e. the dream state, in which is experienced duality consisting 
of objects and the idea of coming in contact with them, though 
such objects do not exist. 


88 


The wise recognize another state, in which there exist neither 
objects nor ideas regarding them. This state is beyond all 
empirical experiences. They describe the three: knowledge, the 
objects of knowledge i.e. the three states and the supremely 
knowable i.e. Ultimate Reality. 


89 


Having known knowledge and the threefold knowable, one 
after another, the knower, endowed with supreme intellect, 
attains in this very life and everywhere, the state of 
omniscience. 


90 


One should be conversant, at the very outset, with four things. 
These are as follows: the things to be avoided, the goal to be 
realized, the disciplines to be cultivated and the tendencies to 
be rendered ineffective. Of these four, all except the goal to be 
realized i.e. the Supreme Reality exist only as products of the 
imagination. 


91 


All Atmans (Dharmas) are to be known, by their very nature, to 
be beginningless and unattached like akasa. There is not the 
slightest variety in there in any way or at any time. 


92 

All jivas are, by their very nature, illumined from the very 
beginning. There can never be any doubt about their nature. He 
who,. having known this, rests without seeking further 
knowledge is alone capable of attaining Immortality. 


93 


The jivas, from the very beginning and by their very nature, are 
all peace, unborn and completely free. They are characterized 


 


by sameness and non—separateness. The unborn Atman is 
always established in sameness and purity. 


94 


Those who always wander in the realm of separateness cannot 
realize the purity of Atman. Their minds are inclined to 
differentiation and they assert the separateness of the Atmans. 
Therefore they are called narrow—minded. 


95 


They alone in this world are endowed with the highest wisdom 
who are firm in their conviction of the sameness and 
birthlessness of Atman. The ordinary man does not understand 
their way. 


96 


Knowledge, which is the very essence of the unborn jivas, is 
itself called unborn and unrelated. This Knowledge is 
proclaimed to be unattached, since it is unrelated to any other 
object. 


97 


To those ignorant people who believe that Atman can deviate 
from Its true nature even in the slightest measure, Its eternally 
unrelated character is lost. In that case the destruction of the 
veil is out of the question. 


98 

All jivas are ever free from bondage and pure by nature. They 
are illumined and free from the very beginning. Yet the wise 
speak of the jivas as capable of knowing Ultimate Reality. 

99 

The Knowledge of the wise man, who is all light, is never 
related to any object. All the jivas, as well as Knowledge, are 
ever unrelated to objects. This is not the view of Buddha. 

100 

Having realized the Knowledge of the Supreme Reality, which 
is hard to grasp, profound, birthless, the same throughout, all 


light and free from multiplicity, we salute It as best we can. 


Aum. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Final Salutation by Sri Sankaracharya 


I salute Brahman, the destroyer of the fear of those who take 
refuge in It—which, though unborn, appears to be associated 
with birth through Its own majestic powers; which, though 
motionless, appears to be moving; and which, though non— 
dual, appears to have assumed many forms to those whose 
vision is deluded by the perception of diverse objects and their 
attributes. 

1 prostrate myself at the feet of the teacher of my teacher, the 
most adored among the adorable, who—out of sheer 
compassion for the beings drowned in the deep ocean of the 
world, infested by the terrible sharks of incessant births and 
deaths—trescued, for the benefit of all, this nectar, hardly 
attainable even by the immortals, from the inmost depths of the 
ocean of the Vedas by churning it with the rod of his illumined 
wisdom. 

I make obeisance with my whole being to those holy feet—the 
dispellers of the fear of the chain of births and deaths—of my 
own great teacher, who, through the light of his illumined 
wisdom, destroyed the darkness of delusion enveloping my 
mind; who put an end, for ever, to my appearance and 
disappearance in this terrible ocean of innumerable births and 
deaths; and who enables all others, too, that take shelter at his 
feet, to attain unfailing knowledge of the scriptures, peace and 
the state of perfect non—differentiation. 


Aum Tat Sat 
Invocation 


May my speech be fixed in my mind, may my mind be fixed in 
my speech! O self—luminous Brahman, be manifested to me. 
O mind and speech, may you bring me the meaning of the 
Vedas! May what I study from the Vedas not leave me! I shall 
unite day and night through this study. I shall think of the right; 
I shall speak the right. May Brahman protect me, may Brahman 
protect the teacher! May Brahman protect me, may Brahman 
protect the teacher! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Aitareya Upanishad 


Part One 
Chapter I — The Creation of Virat 
i 


In the beginning all this verily was Atman only, one and 
without a second. There was nothing else that winked. He 
bethought Himself: "Let Me now create the worlds." 


2 


He created these worlds: Ambhah, the world of water—bearing 
clouds, Marichi, the world of the solar rays, Mara, the world of 
mortals and Ap, the world of waters. Yon is Ambhah, above 
heaven; heaven is its support. The Marichis are the interspace. 
Mara is the earth. What is underneath is Ap. 


3 


He bethought Himself: "Here now are the worlds. Let Me now 
create world—guardians." Right from the waters He drew forth 
the Person in the form of a lump and gave Him a shape. 


4 


He brooded over Him. From Him, so brooded over, the mouth 
was separated out, as with an egg; form the month, the organ of 
speech; from speech, fire, the controlling deity of the organ. 
Then the nostrils were separated out; from the nostrils, the 
organ of breath; from breath, air, the controlling deity of the 
organ. 

Then the eyes were separated out; from the eyes, the organ of 
sight; from sight, the sun, the controlling deity of the organ. 
Then the ears were separated out; from the ears, the organ of 
hearing; from hearing, the quarters of space, the controlling 
deity of the organ. 

Then the skin was separated out; from the skin, hairs, the organ 
of touch; from the hairs, plants and trees, air the controlling 
deity of the organs. 

Then the heart was separated out; from the heart, the organ of 
the mind; from the mind, the moon, the controlling deity of the 
organ. 

Then the navel was separated out; from the navel, the organ of 
the apana; from the apana, Death, Varuna, the controlling deity 
of the organ. 


 


Then the virile member was separated out; from the virile 
member, semen, the organ of generation; from the semen, the 
waters, the controlling deity of the organ. 


Chapter II—Cosmic Powers in the Human Body 
1 


These deities, thus created, fell into this great ocean. He 
subjected the Person to hunger and thirst. They said to Him: 
"Find out for us an abode wherein being established we may eat 
food." 


2—3 


He brought them a cow. They said: "But this is not enough for 
us." He brought them a horse. They said: "This, too, is not 
enough for us." 

He brought them a person. The deities said: "Ah, this is well 
done, indeed." Therefore a person is verily something well 
done. 

He said to the deities: "Now enter your respective abodes." 


4 


The deity fire became the organ of speech and entered the 
mouth. Air became breath and entered the nostrils. The sun 
became sight and entered the eyes; the quarters of space 
became hearing and entered the ears. Plants and trees, the deity 
of air, became hairs and entered the skin. The moon became the 
mind and entered the heart. Death became the apana and 
entered the navel. The waters became semen and entered the 
virile member. 


5 

Hunger and thirst said to the Creator: "For the two of us find an 
abode also." He said to them: "I assign the two of you to these 
deities; I make you co—sharers with them." 

Therefore to whatsoever deity an oblation is made, hunger and 
thirst became sharers in it. 

Chapter I1I—The Embodiment of the Supreme Self 

1 


He bethought Himself: "Here now are the worlds and the 
world—guardians. Let Me cerate food for them." 


 


2 


He brooded over the waters. From the waters, thus brooded 
over, there emerged a condensed form. The form that so 
emerged is indeed food. 


a 


The food so created wished to flee away. He sought to grasp it 
with speech. But He was not able to grasp it with speech. If, 
indeed, He has grasped it with speech, one would then have 
been satisfied by merely uttering the word food 


4—10 


The Creator sought to grasp it with the breath. But He was not 
able to grasp it with the breath. If, indeed, He had grasped it 
with the breath, one would then have been satisfied by merely 
smelling food. 

He sought to grasp it with the eye. But He was not able to grasp 
it with the eye. 

If, indeed, He had grasped it with the eye, one would then have 
been satisfied by merely seeing food. 

He sought to grasp it with the ear. But He was not able to grasp 
it with the ear. 

If, indeed, He had grasped it with the ear, one would then have 
been satisfied by merely hearing of food. 

He sought to grasp it with the skin. But He was not able to 
grasp it with the skin. 

If, indeed, He had grasped it with the skin, one would then have 
been satisfied by merely touching food. 

He sought to grasp it with the mind. But He was not able to 
grasp it with the mind. 

If, indeed, He had grasped it with the mind, one would then 
have been satisfied by merely thinking of food. 

He sought to grasp it with the virile member. But He was not 
able to grasp it with the virile member. 

If, indeed, He had grasped it with the virile member, one would 
then have been satisfied by merely emitting food. 

He sought to grasp it with the apana and He grasped it. 

This grasper of food is what vayu, air or prana is. This vayu is 
what lives on food. 


11 


He bethought Himself: "How could this exist without Me?" 
Then He said to Himself: "Which way shall I enter it?" he said 
to Himself further: "If speech is uttered by the organ of speech, 
if smelling is done by the breath, seeing by the eyes, hearing by 
the ears, touching by the skin, thinking by the mind, eating by 


 


the apana and the emission of semen by the virile member, 
them who am I?" 


12 


So, piercing the end, the Lord entered through that door. That 
door is known as the vidriti, the cleft. This is the place of bliss. 
Atman, thus embodied, has three abodes, three conditions of 
sleep. This is one abode, this is another, this is the third. 


13 


Having been born as the jiva, He realised the elements as one 
with Himself. What else here would one desire to speak about? 
He perceived this very person as the all—pervading Brahman. 
He said: "Ah, I have seen It." 


14 


Therefore He is called Idandra. Idandra, indeed is His name. 
Him who is Idandra they call indirectly Indra. For the gods 
appear to be fond of cryptic epithets; yea, the gods appear to be 
fond of cryptic epithets. 


Part Two 
Chapter I—The Three Births of the Self 
1 


This person is, at first, the germ in a man. That which is the 
semen is here called the germ. This semen is the vigour drawn 
from all the limbs. The man bears the self in the self. When he 
pours the semen into a woman, he gives it a birth. This, indeed, 
is the first birth of the embodied soul. 


2 


That semen becomes one with the woman—just like a limb of 
her own. That is why it does not hurt her. She nourishes this 
self of his that has come into her. 


a 
She, being the nourisher, should be nourished. The woman 
nourishes the embryo. Immediately after its birth he nourishes 


the child, which in the beginning was already born. Nourishing 
the child from birth onward, he thus nourishes himself for the 


 


continuation of these worlds. For thus alone are these worlds 
perpetuated. This is one's second birth. 


4 


He who is the one self of his, is made his substitute for virtuous 
deeds. Then the other self of his, having accomplished his 
duties and reached his age departs. So departing hence, he is 
born again. This is the third birth. 


5 


About this a rishi has said: 

"While still lying in the womb, I came to know all the births of 
the gods. A hundred strongholds, as if made of iron, confined 
me, yet I burst through them all swiftly, like a hawk." 
Vamadeva spoke, in this wise, even while lying in the womb. 


6 


Thus endowed with Knowledge, he, becoming one with the 
Supreme Self and soaring aloft on the dissolution of the body, 
obtained all desires in the heavenly world and became 
immortal—yea, became immortal. 


Part Three 


Chapter I—Concerning the Self 
1 


Who is He whom we worship, thinking: "This is the Self"? 
Which one is the Self? Is it He by whom one sees form, by 
whom one hears sound and by whom one tastes the sweet and 
the unsweet? 


2 


Is it the heart and the mind. It is consciousness, lordship, 
knowledge, wisdom, retentive power of mind, sense 
knowledge, steadfastness, though, thoughtfulness, sorrow, 
memory, concepts, purpose, life, desire, longing: all these are 
but various names of Consciousness (Prajnanam). 


3 
He is Brahman, He is Indra, He is Prajapati; He is all these 


gods; He is the five great elements—earth, air, akasa, water, 
light; He is all these small creatures and the others which are 


 


mixed; He is the origin—those born of an egg, of a womb, of 
sweat and of a sprout; He is horses, cows, human beings, 
elephants—whatever breathes here, whether moving on legs or 
flying in the air or unmoving. All this is guided by 
Consciousness, is supported by Consciousness. The basis is 
Consciousness. Consciousness is Brahman. 


4 


He, having realised oneness with Pure Consciousness, soared 
from this world and having obtained all desires in yonder 
heavenly world, became immortal—yea, became immortal. 


End of Aitareya Upanishad 
The Peace Chant 


May my speech be fixed in my mind, may my mind be fixed in 
my speech! O self—luminous Brahman, be manifest to me. O 
mind and speech, may you bring me the meaning of the Vedas! 
May what I study from the Vedas not leave me! I shall unite 
day and night through this study. I shall think of the right; I 
shall speak the right. May Brahman protect me, may Brahman 
protect the teacher! May Brahman protect me, may Brahman 
protect the teacher! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Invocation 
Om. That is full; this is full. This fullness has been projected 
from that fullness. When this fullness merges in that fullness, 


all that remains is fullness. 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 


Part One 


Chapter I—Meditation on the Horse—sacrifice 
1 


Om, verily, the head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn, its eye 
the sun, its vital breath the wind, its open mouth the Vaisvanara 
fire and the trunk of the sacrificial horse is the year. The back is 
heaven, the belly the intermediate region, the hoof the earth, the 
sides the four quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the 
limbs the seasons, the joints the months and half—months, the 
feet the days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the 
clouds. Its half—digested food is the sand, the blood—vessels 
the rivers, the liver and lungs the mountains, the hair the herbs 
and trees. The fore part of the horse is the rising sun and the 
hinder part the setting sun. Its yawn is lightning, its shaking of 
the body is thunder, its water is rain and its neighing is indeed 
voice. 


2 


The day, verily, is the golden cup called mahiman, in front of 
the horse, which arose pointing it out. Its source is the eastern 
sea. The night, verily, is the silver cup called mahiman, behind 
the horse, which arose pointing it out. Its source is the western 
sea. These two vessels appeared at either end of the horse. As a 
racer the horse carried the gods; as a stallion, the gandharvas; 
as arunner, the demons; as a horse, men. The sea is its stable 
and the sea, its source. 


Chapter II—The Process of Creation 
1 


In the beginning there was nothing whatsoever in the universe. 
By Death, indeed, all this was covered—by hunger, for hunger 
is, verily, death. "Let Me have a mind," was His desire and He 
created the mind. Then He moved about, worshipping Himself. 
From Him, thus worshipping, water was produced. "Verily," 
Death though, "while I was worshipping, water was produced"; 
that is why the Arka (fire used in the Horse—sacrifice) is so 
called. Surely, happiness comes to him who knows how the fire 
came to be called arka. 


 


2 


Water, verily, is arka. What was then like froth on the water 
became solidified; that was earth. After the earth was created, 
Hiranyagarbha was tired. From Him, thus fatigued and heated, 
came forth His essence as brightness. That was Fire. 


3 


He divided Himself into three: the sun one—third and the air 
one—third. Thus Prana is divided into three. His head is the 
east and His arms are that (the north—east) and that (the 
south—east). His hinder part is the west and His two hip— 
bones are that (the north—west) and that (the south—west). His 
sides are the south and the north, His back is heaven, His belly 
is the intermediate region and His chest is the earth. Thus He 
stands firm on water. He who knows this stands firm wherever 
he goes. 


4 


He desired: "Let a second self be born of Me," and He (Death 
or Hunger) brought about the union of speech with the mind. 
What was the seed there became the year. Prior to that there 
had been no year. He (Death) bore him (the year) for as long as 
a year and after that time projected him. Then, when he was 
born, Death opened His mouth to devour him. He (the child) 
cried: "Bhan!" and that, indeed, became speech. 


5 


He thought: "If I kill him, I shall have but very little food," and 
through the union of that speech and that mind He brought 
forth all this, whatever there is: the Rig—Veda, the Yajur— 
Veda, the Sama—Veda, the metres, the sacrifices, men and 
animals. Whatever He brought forth He resolved to eat. Verily, 
because He eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called 
Aditi. He who knows why Aditi came to have this name of 
Aditi becomes the eater of everything and everything becomes 
his food. 


6 


He desired: "Let me sacrifice again with the great sacrifice." He 
was tired and he practiced austerities. From Him thus fatigued 
and heated, His fame and vigour departed. The pranas (organs) 
are verily fame and vigour. When the pranas went out His body 
began to swell, but the mind was set on the body. 


 


7 


He desired: "Let this body of Mine be fit for a sacrifice and let 
Me be embodied through this." Thinking thus, He entered the 
body. Because the body swelled (asvat), therefore it came to be 
called horse (asva). And because it became fit for sacrifice 
(medhya), therefore the Horse—sacrifice came to be known as 
Asvamedha. He who knows this verily knows the Horse— 
sacrifice. 

Prajapati, desiring again to sacrifice with the great sacrifice, 
imagined Himself as the horse and letting the horse remain 
free, He reflected on it. At the end of a year he sacrificed it to 
Himself and dispatched the other animals to the gods. 
Therefore priests even now sacrifice to Prajapati the sanctified 
horse dedicated to all the gods. 

Verily, the sun who shines yonder is the Horse—sacrifice. His 
body is the year. This earthly fire is the arka (sacrificial fire), 
whose limbs are these worlds. So these two, fire and the sun, 
are the arka and the Asvamedha (Horse—sacrifice). These two, 
again, become the same god, Death. He who knows this 
conquers further death; death cannot overcome him; death 
becomes his self; and he becomes one with these deities. 


Chapter I1I—The Prana: Its Glories and Redeeming Power 
1 


There were two classes of Prajapati's sons: the gods (devas) 
and the demons (asuras). Naturally, the gods were few and the 
demons many. They struggled with one another for mastery of 
these worlds. Being overwhelmed by the demons, the gods 
said: "Well, let Us overcome the demons at the sacrifice 
(jyotishtoma) by means of the Udgitha." 


2 


They said to the organ of speech: "Chant the Udgitha for us." 
"So be it," said speech and chanted for them. Whatever 
enjoyment common to all comes from the organ of speech, it 
secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived 
from the fine utterance of the words it utilized for itself. Now, 
the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would 
overcome them. They charged at it (speech) and pierced it with 
evil. That evil is what is found today when one speaks 
improperly; that is that evil. 


3 
Then they said to the organ of smell: "Chant the Udgitha for 


us." "So be it," said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever 


 


enjoyment common to all comes from the nose, it secured for 
the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine 
smelling it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that 
through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They 
charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found 
today when one smells improper things; that is that evil. 


4 


Then they said to the organ of Seeing: "Chant the Udgitha for 
us." "So be it," said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever 
enjoyment common to all comes from the eye, it secured for the 
gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine seeing 
it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this 
chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and 
pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one 
sees improper things; that is that evil. 


5 


Then they said to the organ of hearing: "Chant the Udgitha for 
us." "So be it," said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever 
enjoyment common to all comes from the ear, it secured for the 
gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine 
hearing it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that 
through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They 
charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found 
today when one hears improper things; that is that evil. 


6 


Then they said to the mind: "Chant the Udgitha for us." "So be 
it," said the mind and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment 
common to all comes from the mind, it secured for the gods by 
chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine thinking it 
utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this 
chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and 
pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one 
thinks improperly; that is that evil. 

Likewise they also touched these other deities with evil—smote 
them with evil. 


7 


Then they said to the vital breath in the mouth: "Chant the 
Udgitha for us." "So be it," said the vital breath and chanted for 
them. The demons knew that through this chanter the gods 
would overcome them. They charged at it, intending to pierce it 
with evil. But as a clod of earth, hitting a stone, is scattered, 
even so they were scattered in all directions, crushed and 


 


completely destroyed. Thereupon the gods became established 
in their true selves and the demons perished. He who knows 
this becomes his true self and his spiteful kinsman perishes. 


8 


Then the organs said: "Where is that which joined us to our true 
selves?" After deliberation they discovered that it was here, 
within the mouth (asye). Hence the vital breath (prana) is called 
ayasya and also, because it is the essence (rasa) of the limbs 
(anga) of the body, angirasa. 


9 


That deity is called "dur," because death is far (dur) from it. 
From him who knows this, death is far away. 


10 


That deity took away death, the evil of these gods and carried it 
to where the end of the quarters is. There it deposited their evil. 
Therefore let no one go to a person of that region, or to the 
country beyond the border, lest he should meet there with evil, 
with death. 


11 


That deity, after taking away the death—the evil—of the gods, 
carried them beyond death. 


12 


First of all, it carried the organ of speech, which is the foremost 
organ. When the organ of speech was freed from death it 
became fire. That fire, having transcended death, shines beyond 
its reach. 


13—15 


Then it carried the organ of smell. When it was freed from 
death it became air (Vayu). That air, having transcended death, 
blows beyond its reach. 

Then it carried the organ of sight. When it was freed from death 
it became the sun (Surya). That sun, having transcended death, 
shines beyond its reach. 

Then it carried the organ of hearing. When it was freed from 
death, it became the quarters (Disah). Those quarters, having 
transcended death, remain beyond its reach. 


 


16 


Then it carried the mind. When the mind was freed from death 
it became the moon (Chandra). That moon, having transcended 
death, shines beyond its reach. Thus, verily, that deity carries 
beyond death him who knows this. 


17 


Next it (the vital breath) obtained eatable food for itself by 
chanting. For whatever food is eaten, is eaten by the vital 
breath alone and it (the vital breath) rests on that (the food). 


18 


The gods said to the vital breath: "Verily, just this much is all 
the food there is and you have secured it for yourself by 
chanting. Now give us, please, a share of this food." 

"Then sit around facing me." 

"So be it." 

They sat down around the vital breath. That is why whatever 
food one eats through the vital breath satisfies the organs. 

So do his relatives sit around facing him who knows this; he 
becomes the supporter of his kinsmen, the greatest among them 
and their leader, a good eater of food and their lord. 

Whoever, among his kinsmen, the greatest among them and 
their leader, a good eater of food and their lord. 

Whoever, among his kinsmen, desires to be a rival of the man 
who has this knowledge is not able to support his dependents. 
But, on the other hand, he who follows him (the knower of the 
vital breath) and who, following him, desires to support his 
dependents is certainly able to do so. 


19 


It is called ayasa angirasa, for it is the essence (rasa) of the 
limbs (anga). Yes, the prana is the essence of the limbs. From 
whichever limb the vital breath departs, that limb withers right 
there; therefore it is verily the essence of the limbs. 


20 
It is also Brihaspati (lord of the Rig—Veda). Speech is Brihati 


(Rig) and the vital breath is its lord (pati). Therefore it is called 
Brihaspati. 


 


21 


It is also the Brahmanaspati (lord of the Yajur—Veda). Speech 
is Brahman (Yajur) and the vital breath is its lord (pati). 
Therefore it is called Brahmanaspati. 


22 


Prana is Saman, too. Speech is, verily, sa and this (prana) is 
ama. Saman (the chant of the Sama—vVeda) is known by that 
name because it is sa (speech) and ama (prana). Or because it 
(prana) is equal (sama) to a white ant, equal to a mosquito, 
equal to an elephant, equal to these three worlds, nay, equal to 
this universe; therefore it (prana) is indeed the Sama—Veda. 
He who knows this vital breath to be such attains union with it 
or lives in the same world with it. 


23 


And it is also the Udgitha. The vital breath is verily ut, for by 
the vital breath all this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and 
speech is githa (song). And because it is ut and githa, therefore 
it is Udgitha. 


24 


Regarding this there is also the following anecdote: 
Brahmadatta, the great—grandson of Chikitana, while drinking 
king som, said: "Let this soma strike off my head if I say that 
the ayasya angirasa chanted the Udgitha through any other 
means than this vital breath and speech." Surely he chanted 
through speech and the vital breath. 


25 


He who knows the wealth of this saman (Vital breath) obtains 
wealth. Tone, indeed, is its wealth. Therefore let one who is 
going to perform the sacrificial work as a priest desire that his 
voice may have a good tone and let him perform the sacrifice 
through that voice with a good tone. Therefore people desire to 
see at a sacrifice a priest with a good voice, like one who has 
wealth. He who thus knows what is the wealth of the saman 
obtains wealth. 


26 
He who knows the suvarna (gold) of the saman (vital breath) 


obtains gold. Tone is verily its gold. He who thus knows what 
is the gold of the saman obtains gold. 


 


27 


He who knows the support of the saman (vital breath) gets a 
support. Speech Verily is its support. For, supported in speech, 
the vital breath is transformed into a chant. Some say the 
support is in food (the body).

Next follows the edifying repetition (abhyaroha) only of the 
hymns called pavamanas. The priest called prastotri indeed 
chants the saman. While he chants it, let the sacrificer recite 
these Yajur verse: 

"Lead me from the unreal to the real. From darkness lead me to 
light. From death lead me to immortality." 

When the mantra (verse) says: "Lead me from the unreal to the 
real," "the unreal" means death and the "real," immortality; so it 
says, "From death lead me to immortality," that is to say, 
"Make me immortal." 

When it says: "From darkness lead me to light," "darkness" 
means death and "light," immortality; so it says: "From death 
lead me to immortality," that is to say, "Make me immortal." 
In the verse: "From death lead me to immortality," there is 
nothing that is hidden. 

Then come the remaining hymns, with which, by singing them, 
the chante should obtain food for himself. Therefore while 
they are being chanted let the sacrificer ask for a boon— 
anything that he desires. Whatever objects this chanter, 
endowed with such knowledge, desires for himself or for the 
sacrificer, he obtains by his chanting. This meditatio by 
itself wins the world (Hiranyagarbha). He who thus knows the 
saman (the prana, or vital breath)—for him there is no fear of 
not being admitted into that world. 


Chapter V—The Creation and Its Cause 
1 


In the beginning, this universe was the self (Viraj) alone, in the 
shape of a person. He reflected and saw nothing else but His 
self. He first said: "I am He." Therefore He came to be known 
by the name I (Aham). Hence, even now, when a person is 
addressed, he first says: "It is I," and then says whatever other 
name he may have. And because He, before (purva) the whole 
group of aspirants, burnt (aushat) all evils, therefore He is 
called Purusha. He who knows this verily burns up him who 
wishes to be Viraj in advance of him. 


 


2 


He was afraid. Therefore people still are afraid when alone. He 
thought: "Since there is nothing else but Myself, what am I 
afraid of?" Thereupon His fears were gone; for what was there 
to fear? Assuredly, it is from a second entity that fear arises. 


3 


He was not at all happy. Therefore a person even today is not 
happy when alone. He desired a mate. He became the size of a 
man and wife in close embrace. He divided this body into two. 
From that division arose husband (pati) and wife (patni). 
Therefore, as Yajnavalkya said, the body before one accepts a 
wife is one half of oneself, like the half of a split pea. Therefore 
this space is indeed filled by the wife. He was united with her. 
From that union human beings were born. 


4 


She reflected: "How can he unite with me after having 
produced me from himself? Well, let me hide myself." She 
became a cow, the other (Manu) became a bull and was united 
with her; from that union cows were born. The one became a 
mare, the other became a stallion; the one became a she—ass, 
the other became a he—ass and was united with her; from that 
union one—hoofed animals were born. The one became a 
she—goat, the other became a he—goat; the one became a hew, 
the other became a ram and was united with her; from that 
union goats and sheep were born. Thus, indeed, he produced 
everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants. 


a 


He (Viraj) realized: "Indeed, I am the creation, for I produced 
all this." Therefore He became the creation. He who knows this 
becomes a creator in this creation of Viraj. 


6 


Then He (Viraj) rubbed back and forth thus and produced fire 
from its source: the mouth and the hands. Therefore both the 
hands and mouth are hairless inside. 

When they (the priests) speak of particular gods, saying: 
"Sacrifice to him," "Sacrifice to that one," they are mistaken; 
for these are all His manifestations: He Himself is all the gods. 
Now, whatever is liquid, He produced from semen; and that is 
soma. This universe is indeed this much: food and the eater of 
food. Soma is food; and fire, the eater of food. This is the 
highest creation of Viraj, that He projected the gods, who are 


 


even superior to Him. This is the highest creation because He, 
although mortal Himself, manifested the immortal. And he who 
knows this verily becomes a creator in this highest creation of 
Viraj. 


7 


Now, all this universe was then undifferentiated. It became 
differentiated by name and form: it was known by such and 
such a name and such and such a form. Thus to this day this 
universe is differentiated by name and form; so it is said. "He 
has such a name and such a form." 

This Self has entered into these bodies up to the very tips of the 
nails, as a razor lies hidden in its case, or as fire, which sustains 
the world, lies hidden in its source. People do not see the Self, 
for when viewed in parts It is incomplete: when breathing, It is 
called the vital breath (prana); when speaking, the organ of 
speech; when seeing, the eye; when hearing, the ear; when 
thinking, the mind. These are merely Its names according to Its 
functions. He who meditates on one or another of Its aspects 
does not know, for It is then incomplete: the Self is separated 
from Its totality by being associated with a single characteristic. 
The Self alone is to be meditated upon, for in It all these 
become unified. Of all these, this Self alone should be known, 
for one knows all these through It, just as one may find an 
animal which is lost through its footprints. He who thus knows 
the Self obtains fame and association with dear ones. 


8 


This Self is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than 
everything else, because It is innermost. If one holding the Self 
dear were to say to a person who speaks of anything other than 
the Self as dear, that he, the latter, will lose what he holds 
dear—and the former is certainly competent to do so—it will 
indeed come true. 

One should meditate upon the Self alone as dear. He who 
meditates upon the Self alone as dear—what he holds dear will 
not perish. 


9 

They say: "Since men think that by the Knowledge of Brahman 
they become all, what, pray, was it that Brahman knew by 
which It became all?" 


10 


This self was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself 
only as "I am Brahman." Therefore it became all. And whoever 


 


among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That 
Brahman. It is the same with the seers (rishis), the same with 
men. The seer Vamadeva, having realized this self as That, 
came to know: "I was Manu and the sun." And to this day, 
whoever in a like manner knows the self as "I am Brahman," 
becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevent his 
becoming this, for he has become their Self. 

Now, if a man worships another deity, thinking: "He is one and 
I am another," he does not know. He is like an animal to the 
gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve 
the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish to 
the owner; how much more so when many are taken away! 
Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know 
this. 


11 


In the beginning this (the kshatriya and other castes) was 
indeed Brahman, one only without a second. He, being one, did 
not flourish. He projected, further, an excellent form, 
kshatriyahood—those kshatriyas (rulers) among the gods: 
Indra, Varuna, Soma (Moon), Rudra, Parjanya, Yama, Mrityu 
(Death) and Isana. Therefore there is none higher than the 
kshatriyas. Thus at the Rajasuya sacrifice, the brahmin sits 
below and worships the kshatriya. He confers that glory on 
kshatriyahood alone. But brahminhood is nevertheless the 
source of kshatriyahood. Therefore even though the king is 
exalted in the sacrifice, at the end of it he resorts to 
brahminhood as his source. He who slights a brahmin strikes at 
his own source. He becomes more evil, as one who slights his 
superior. 


12 


Yet He (Viraj) did not flourish. He projected the Vaisya 
caste—those classes of gods who are designated in groups: the 
Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Visve—devas and Maruts. 


13 


Still He did not flourish. He projected the sudra caste—Pushan. 
This earth is Verily Pushan (the nourisher); for it nourishes all 
that exists. 


14 
Yet He did not flourish. He projected, further, that excellent 
form, justice (dharrna). This justice is the controller of the 


kshatriya. Therefore there is nothing higher than justice. So 
even a weak man hopes to defeat a stronger man through 


 


justice, as one does with the help of a king. Verily, that which 

is justice is truth. Therefore if a man speaks the truth, they say 

he speaks what is just and if he speaks what is just, they say he 
speaks the truth; for justice alone is both these. 


15 


So these four castes were projected: the brahmin: the kshatriya, 
the vaisya and the sudra. Among the gods Prajapati became a 
brahmin as fire and among men He became the brahmin. He 
became a kshatriya among men through the divine kshatriyas, a 
vaisya through the divine vaisyas and a sudra through the 
divine sudras. Therefore people desire to attain the results of 
their rites among the gods through fire and among men as a 
brahmin. For Prajapati directly projected Himself as these two 
forms. 

Now, if a man departs from this world without realizing his 
own World (the Self), It, being unknown, does not protect 
him—as the Vedas, unrecited, or as a deed unaccomplished, do 
not protect him. Nay, even if one who does not know It (the 
Self) should perform here on earth a great many meritorious 
acts, those acts will in the end surely perish for him. One 
should meditate only upon the World called the Self. He who 
meditates upon the World called the Self—his work does not 
perish; for from this very Self he projects whatever he desires. 


16 


Now, this self (the ignorant person) is an object of enjoyment 
(lokah) to all beings. In so far as he offers oblations in the fire 
and performs sacrifices, he becomes an object of enjoyment to 
the gods. In so far as he studies the Vedas, he becomes an 
object of enjoyment to the rishis. In so far as he makes 
offerings to the Manes and desires children, he becomes an 
object of enjoyment to the Manes. In so far as he gives shelter 
and food to men, he becomes an object of enjoyment to men. In 
so far as he gives fodder and water to the animals, he becomes 
an object of enjoyment to the animals. In so far as beasts and 
birds and even ants find a living in his home, he becomes an 
object of enjoyment to these. Just as one wishes no injury to 
one's body, so do all beings wish no injury to him who has this 
knowledge. All this, indeed, has been known and well 
investigated. 


17 
In the beginning this aggregate of desirable objects was but the 
self, one only. He cherished the desire: "Let me have a wife, so 


that I may be born as the child; and let me have wealth, so that I 
may perform rites." This much, indeed, is the range of desire; 


 


even if one wishes, one cannot get more than this. Therefore, to 
this day, a man who is single desires: "Let me have a wife, so 
that I may be born as the child; and let me have wealth, so that I 
may perform rites." So long as he does not obtain each one of 
these, he thinks he is incomplete. 

Now, his completeness can also come in this way: The mind is 
his self, speech his wife, the vital breath his child, the eye his 
human wealth, for he finds it with the eye; the ear his divine 
wealth, for he hears it with the ear; the body his instrument of 
rites, for he performs rites through the body. So this sacrifice 
has five factors—the animals have five factors, men have five 
factors and all this that exists has five factors. He who knows 
this obtains all this. 


Chapter V—Manifestations of Prajapati 
1 


The following are the mantras: 

"I shall now disclose that the father produced seven kinds of 
food through meditation and rites. One is common to all eaters. 
Two he assigned to the gods. Three he designed for himself. 
And one he gave to the animals. On it (food) rests everything— 
whatsoever breathes and whatsoever breathes not. Why are not 
these foods exhausted although they are always being eaten? 
He who knows the cause of this inexhaustibility of the food 
eats food with pre—eminence (pratika). He obtains identity 
with the gods and lives on nectar." 


2 


When it is said: "That the father produced seven kinds of food 
through meditation and rites," the statement means that the 
father indeed produced them through meditation and rites. 
When it is said: "One is common to all eaters," it means that the 
food which is eaten is that which is common to all. He who 
appropriates this food is never free from evil, for this is, verily, 
the general food. When it is said: "Two he assigned to the 
gods," the statement means oblations made in the fire and 
presents offered otherwise to the gods. Therefore people make 
oblations in the fire and offer presents otherwise to the gods. 
Some, however, say that the two foods refer to the new—moon 
and full—moon sacrifices. Therefore one should not engage in 
sacrifices for material ends. When it is said: "One he gave to 
the animals," the statement refers to milk; for at first men and 
animals live on milk alone. That is why they first make a 
new—born babe lick melted butter or they put it to the breast. 
And they speak of the new—born calf as not yet eating grass. 
When it is said: "On it rests everything—whatsoever breathes 
and whatsoever breathes not," it means that everything rests on 


 


milk, all that breathes and breathes not. It is further said in 
another Brahmana that by making offerings of milk in the fire 
for a year one overcomes further death; but one should not 
think thus. For he who knows this overcomes further death the 
very day he makes the offering, because he offers all eatable 
food to the gods. When it is asked: "Why are not these foods 
exhausted although they are always being eaten?" the answer is 
that the eater is indeed the cause of this inexhaustibility, for he 
produces this food again and again. When it is said: "He who 
knows the cause of this inexhaustibility," the statement means 
that the eater is indeed the cause of this inexhaustibility, for he 
produces this food through meditation and rites. If he did not do 
this the food would be exhausted. When it is said: "He eats 
food with pratika," the word pratika means pre—eminence; 
hence the meaning is that he eats food pre—eminently. The 
statement: "He obtains identity with the gods and lives on 
nectar," is a eulogy. 


3 


"Three he designed for himself"—that is to say, the mind, the 
organ of speech and the vital breath; these he designed for 
himself. They say: "My mind was elsewhere, I did not see it; 
my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear it." It is clear that a man 
sees with his mind and hears with his mind. Desire, 
determination, doubt, faith, lack of faith, steadfastness, lack of 
steadfastness, shame, intelligence and fear—all this is truly the 
mind. Even if one is touched from behind, one knows it 
through the mind; therefore the mind exists. 

Whatever sound there is, it is just the organ of speech; for it 
serves to determine a thing, but it cannot itself be revealed. 
The prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana and ana—all these are 
but the vital breath (prana). This body (atma) consists of 
these—the organ of speech, the mind and the vital breath. 


4 


These verily are the three worlds: the organ of speech is this 
world (the earth), the mind is the intermediary world (the sky) 
and the vital breath is that world (heaven). 


3 
These verily are the three Vedas: the organ of speech is the 


Rig—Veda, the mind is the Yajur—Veda and the vital breath is 
the Sama—Veda. 





 


6 


These verily are the gods, the Manes and men: the organ of 
speech is the gods, the mind is the Manes and the vital breath is 
men. 


a 


These verily are father, mother and child: the mind is the father, 
the organ of speech is the mother and the vital force is the 
child. 


8—10 


These verily are what is known, what is to be known and what 
is unknown. Whatever is known is a form of the organ of 
speech, for it is the knower. The organ of speech protects him 
who knows its different manifestations by becoming that which 
is known). 

Whatever is to be known is a form of the mind, for the mind is 
what is to be known. The mind protects him who knows this by 
becoming that which is to be known. 

Whatever is unknown is a form of the vital breath, for the vital 
breath is what is unknown. The vital breath protects him who 
knows this by becoming that which is unknown. 


11 


The earth is the body of that organ of speech and this fire is its 
luminous organ. And as far as the organ of speech extends, so 
far extends the earth and so far extends fire. 


12 


Now, heaven is the body of this mind and that sun yonder is its 
luminous organ. And as far as the mind extends, so far extends 
the earth and so far extends fire. The two (fire and the sun) 
were united and from that was born the vital breath. It (the vital 
breath) is the supreme Lord (Indra). It is without a rival. A 
second being is, indeed, a rival. He who knows this has no 
rival. 


13 


Next, water is the body of this vital breath and that moon 
yonder is its luminous organ. And as far as the vital breath 
extends, so far extends water and so far extends the moon. 
These are all equal, all infinite. He who meditates upon them as 
finite wins a finite world, but he who meditates upon them as 
infinite wins an infinite world. 


 


14 


That Prajapan, represented by the year, consists of sixteen 
parts. The nights and days are fifteen of his parts and the 
constant point is the sixteenth. He as the moon is increased and 
decreased by the nights and days. Through the sixteenth part he 
permeates all living beings as the new—moon night and rises 
the following morning. Therefore, in honour of this deity, on 
this night let no one cut off the breath of any breathing being, 
not even of a lizard. 


15 


Verily, the person who knows this is himself that Prajapati who 
is endowed with sixteen parts and who is represented by the 
year. Wealth constitutes fifteen of his parts and the body is his 
sixteenth part. He is increased and decreased by that wealth. 
This body is the nave and wealth is the felloe. Therefore even if 
a man loses everything, but lives in his body, people say that he 
has lost only his felloe which can be restored again. 


16 


Now, these are, verily, the three worlds: the world of men, the 
world of the Manes and the world of the gods. The world of 
men can be gained through a son only and by no other rite; the 
world of the Manes through rites; and the world of the gods 
through meditation. The world of the gods is the best of the 
worlds. Therefore they praise meditation. 


17 


Now therefore follows the entrusting: When a man thinks he is 
about to die, he says to his son: "You are Brahman, you are the 
sacrifice and you are the world." The son replies: "I am 
Brahman, I am the sacrifice, I am the world." 

The Sruti explains the thoughts of the father: 

"Whatever has been studied by me (the father) is all unified in 
the word Brahman. Whatever sacrifices have been made by me 
(the father) are all unified in the word sacrifice. And whatever 
worlds were to be; won by me (the father) are all unified in the 
word world. All this it indeed this much. He (the son), being all 
this, will protect me from the ties of this world." Therefore they 
speak of a son who is well instructed as being conducive to the 
winning of the world; and therefore a father instructs him. 
When a father who knows this departs from this world, he— 
along with his own organ of speech, mind and vital breath— 
penetrates his son. If, through a lapse, any duty has been left 
undone by him, the son exonerates him from all that; therefore 
he is called a son. The father remains in this world through the 


 


son. The divine and immortal organ of speech, mind and vital 
breath enter into him (the father). 


18 


The divine organ of speech from the earth and fire enters into 
him. That is the divine organ of speech through which whatever 
he says is fulfilled. 


19 


The divine mind from heaven and the sun permeates him. That 
is the divine mind through which he becomes joyful only and 
grieves no more. 


20 


The divine vital breath from water and the moon permeates 
him. And, verily, that is the divine vital breath which, whether 
moving or not moving, neither feels pain nor is injured. He who 
knows this becomes the self of all beings. As is this deity 
(Hiranyagarbha), so is he. And as all beings honour this deity, 
so do they honour him. Howsoever creatures may grieve, that 
grief of theirs remains with them but only merit goes to him. 
No demerit ever goes to the gods. 


21 


Next follows the consideration of the vow (meditative 
worship): 

Prajapati projected the organs. They, when they were projected, 
quarrelled with one another. The organ of speech resolved: "I 
will go on speaking"; the eye: "I will go on seeing"; the ear: "I 
will go on hearing." So did the other organs, according to their 
functions. Death, having taken the form of weariness, laid hold 
of them—it overtook them and having overtaken them, 
restrained them. Therefore does the organ of speech become 
tired and so do the eye and the ear. But death did not overtake 
the vital breath (prana) in the body. The other organs resolved 
to know it and said: "This is verily the greatest among us; 
whether moving or not moving, it neither feels pain nor is 
injured. Well then, let us assume its form." They all assumed its 
form. Therefore they are called pranas after it. 

In whatever family there is a man who knows this—that family 
they call by his name. And whoever competes with one who 
knows this, shrivels and after shrivelling, in the end dies. This 
is with regard to the body. 

 


22 


Now with regard to the gods. Fire resolved: "I will go on 
burning"; the sun: "I will go on giving heat"; the moon: "I will 
go on shining." And so did the other gods, according to their 
functions. As is the vital breath in the body among the organs, 
so 1s air (vayu) among the gods. The other gods fade, but not 
air. Air is the deity that never sets. 


23 


Now there is this verse (sloka): 

The gods observed the vow of that from which the sun rises and 
in which it sets. This vow is followed today and this will be 
followed tomorrow. The sun rises verily from the prana (the 
vital breath in its cosmic form) and also sets in it. The gods 
even today observe the same vow which they observed then. 
Therefore a man should observe a single vow—he should 
perform the functions of the prana and apana (respiration and 
excretion), lest the evil of death should overtake him. And if he 
performs them, let him try to complete them. Through this he 
obtains identity with that deity, or lives in the same world with 
it. 


Chapter VI—The Three Aspects of the Universe 
1 


Verily, this universe is a triad of name, form and work. Of 
those names which are in daily use, speech (sound in general) is 
the source (uktha), for from it all names arise. It is their 
common feature (saman), for it is common to all names. It is 
their Brahman (self), for it supports all names. 


2 


Next, of forms, the eye is the source (uktha), for from it all 
forms arise. It is their Common feature (saman), for it is 
common to all forms. It is their Brahman (self), for it supports 
all forms. 


3 


Next, of work, the body is the source (uktha), for from it all 
works arise. It is their common feature (saman), for it is 
common to all works. It is their Brahman (self), for it supports 
all works. 

These three together are one—this body; and the body, 
although one, is these three. This immortal entity is covered by 


 


truth: the vital breath is the immortal entity and name and form 
are truth and by them the immortal entity is covered. 


Part Two 
Chapter I—Relative Aspects of Brahman 
I 


Om. There lived of yore a man of the Garga family called 
proud Balaki, who was an eloquent speaker. He said to 
Ajatasatru, the king of Kasi: "I will tell you about Brahman." 
Ajatasatru said: "For this proposal I give you a thousand cows. 
People indeed rush, saying: 'Janaka, Janaka.' I too have some of 
his virtues." 


2 


Gargya said: "That being (purusha) who is in the sun, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk to me about him. I meditate upon him as all— 
surpassing, as the head of all beings and as resplendent." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him becomes all—surpassing, 
the head of all beings and resplendent. 


3 


Gargya said: "That being (purusha) who is in the moon, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk to me about him. I meditate upon him as the great, 
white—robed, radiant Soma." Whosoever thus meditates upon 
him has, every day, abundant soma pressed for him in his 
principal and auxiliary sacrifices and his food never runs short. 


4 


Gargya said: "That being (purusha) who is in the lightning, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk to me about him. I meditate upon him as luminous." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him becomes luminous and his 
progeny too become luminous. 


5 
Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in the akasa, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 


do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as full and 
unmoving." Whosoever thus meditates upon him is filled with 


 


progeny and cattle and his progeny is never extinct from this 
world. 


6 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in the air, I meditate 
upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please do not talk 
about him. I meditate upon him as the Lord (Indra), as 
irresistible and as the unvanquished army." Whosoever thus 
meditates upon him becomes ever victorious, invincible and a 
conqueror of enemies. 


7 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in fire, I meditate 
upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please do not talk 
about him. I meditate upon him as forbearing." Whosoever thus 
meditates upon him becomes forbearing and his progeny 
becomes forbearing. 


8 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in water, I meditate 
upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please do not talk 
about him. I meditate upon him as agreeable." Whosoever thus 
meditates upon him—to him comes what is agreeable, not what 
is disagreeable and to him are born children who are agreeable. 


9 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in the mirror, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as shining." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him becomes shining and his 
progeny too becomes shining and he outshines all those with 
whom he comes in contact. 


10 


Gargya said: "The sound that arises behind a man while he 
walks, I meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! 
Please do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as life." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him reaches his full age on this 
earth and life does not depart from him before the completion 
of that time. 


11 
Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in the quarters, I 


meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 


 


do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as second and as 
inseparable." Whosoever thus mediates upon him gets 
companions and his followers never part with him. 


12 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who consists of shadow, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as death." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him reaches his full age on this 
earth and death does not overtake him before the completion of 
that time. 


13 


Gargya said: "This being (purusha) who is in the self, I 
meditate upon as Brahman." Ajatasatru said: "No, no! Please 
do not talk about him. I meditate upon him as self—possessed." 
Whosoever thus meditates upon him becomes self—possessed 
and his progeny too becomes self—possessed. Gargya 
remained silent. 


14 


Ajatasatru said: "Is this all?" "That is all." "By knowing that 
much one cannot know Brahman." "Let me approach you as a 
student," said Gargya. 


15 


Ajatasatru said: "It is contrary to usual practice that a brahmin 
should approach a kshatriya, thinking: 'He will teach me about 
Brahman.' Nevertheless, I will instruct you." So saying, he took 
Gargya by the hand and rose. They came to a sleeping man. 
Ajatasatru addressed him by these names: Great, White— 
robed, Radiant, Soma. The man did not get up. The king 
pushed him again and again with his hand till he awoke. Then 
he got up. 


16 

Ajatasatru said: "When this being full of consciousness 
(identified with the intellect) was thus asleep, where was it then 
and whence did it thus come back?" Gargya did not know the 
answer. 


17 


Ajatasatru said: "When this being full of consciousness 
(vijnana maya) is thus asleep, it absorbs, at that time, the 


 


functions of the organs through its own consciousness and rests 
in the Supreme Self (akasa) that is in the heart. When this being 
absorbs them, it is called svapiti. Then the organ of smell is 
absorbed, the organ of speech is absorbed, the eye is absorbed, 
the ear is absorbed and the mind is absorbed." 


18 


When the self remains in the dream state, these are its 
achievements (results of past action): It then becomes a great 
king, as it were; or a noble brahmin, as it were; or attains, as it 
were, high or low states. Even as a great king, taking with him 
his retinue of citizens, moves about, according to his pleasure, 
within his own domain, so does the self, taking with it the 
organs, move about according to its pleasure, in the body. 


19 


Next, when the self goes into deep sleep—when it does not 
know anything—it returns along the seventy—two thousand 
nerves called hita, which extend from the heart throughout the 
whole body and remains in the body. As a baby or an emperor 
or a noble brahmin lives, having reached the summit of 
happiness, so does the self rest. 


20 


As the spider moves along the thread it produces, or as from a 
fire tiny sparks fly in all directions, even so from this Atman 
come forth all organs, all worlds, all gods, all beings. Its secret 
name (Upanishad) is "the Truth of truth." The vital breaths are 
the truth and their truth is Atman. 


Chapter II—Description of the Prana 
1 


He who knows the calf together with its abode, its special 
resort, its post and its rope, kills his seven hostile kinsmen. The 
vital breath in the body is indeed the calf; this body is its abode, 
the head its special resort, strength its post and food its rope. 


2 


These seven gods that prevent decay worship it (the calf): 
through these pink lines in the eye, Rudra attends on it; through 
the water in the eye, Parjanya attends on it; through the pupil of 
the eye, the sun attends on it; through the black of the eye, fire 
attends on it; through the white portion, Indra; through the 


 


lower eyelid, the earth; and through the upper eyelid, heaven 
attends on it. He who knows this—his food does not diminish. 


3 


Regarding this there is the following mantra: "There is a bowl 
which has its mouth below and which bulges at the top. 
Manifold knowledge has been put into it; seven sages sit on its 
rim and the organ of speech, which has communication with 
the Vedas, is the eighth." What is called the "bowl which has its 
mouth below and which bulges at the top" is this head of ours, 
for it is a bowl which has its mouth below and which bulges at 
the top. When it is said: "Manifold knowledge has been put into 
it," this refers to the organs; these indeed represent manifold 
knowledge. When it is said: "Seven sages sit on its rim," this 
refers to the organs; they indeed are the sages. "The organ of 
speech, which has communication with the Vedas, is the 
eighth" because the organ of speech is the eighth and 
communicates with the Vedas.

These two ears are Gotama and Bharadvaja: this one (the right) 
is Gotama and this one (the left), Bharadvaja. These two eyes 
are Visvamitra and Jamadagni: this one (the right) is 
Visvamitra and this one (the left), Jamadagni. These two 
nostrils are Vasishtha and Kasyapa: this one (the right) is 
Vasishtha and this one (the left), Kasyapa. The tongue is Atri, 
for through the tongue food is eaten. Atri is the same as atti 
(eating). He who knows this becomes the eater of everything 
and everything becomes his food. 


Chapter 11I—The Two Forms of Brahman 
1 


Verily, there are two forms of Brahman: gross and subtle, 
mortal and immortal, limited and unlimited, definite and 
indefinite. 


2 


The gross form is that which is other than air and akasa. It is 
mortal, limited and definite. The essence of that which is gross, 
which is mortal, which is limited and which is definite is the 
sun that shines, for it (the sun) is the essence of the three 
elements. 


 


3 


Now the subtle: It is air and akasa. It is immortal, it is unlimited 
and it is indefinite. The essence of that which is subtle, which is 
immortal, which is unlimited and which is indefinite is the 
Person (Purusha) in the solar orb, for that Person is the essence 
of the two elements. This is with reference to the gods. 


4 


Now with reference to the body: The gross form is that which is 
other than the air and the akasa that is in the body. It is mortal, 
it is limited and it is definite. The essence of that which is 
gross, which is mortal, which is limited and which is definite is 
the eye; for it (the eye) is the essence of the three elements. 


5 


Now the subtle: It is the air and the akasa that is in the body. It 
is immortal, it is unlimited and it is indefinite. The essence of 
that which is subtle, which is immortal, which is unlimited and 
which is indefinite is the person (purusha) that is in the right 
eye, for that person is the essence of the two elements. 


6 


The form of that person is like a cloth dyed with turmeric, or 
like grey sheep's wool, or like the scarlet insect called 
Indragopa, or like a tongue of fire, or like a white lotus, or like 
a flash of lightning. He who knows this—his splendour is like a 
flash of lightning. Now, therefore, the description of Brahman: 
"Not this, not this" (Neti, Neti); for there is no other and more 
appropriate description than this "Not this." Now the 
designation of Brahman: "The Truth of truth." The vital breath 
is truth and It (Brahman) is the Truth of that. 


Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi (I) 

i 

"Maitreyi, my dear," said Yajnavalkya, "I am going to renounce 
this life. Let me make a final settlement between you and 
Katyayani (his other wife)." 

2 

Thereupon Maitreyi said: "Venerable Sir, if indeed the whole 


earth, full of wealth, belonged to me, would I be immortal 
through that?" "No," replied Yajnavalkya, "your life would be 


 


just like that of people who have plenty. Of Immortality, 
however, there is no hope through wealth." 


a 


Then Maitreyi said: "What should I do with that which would 
not make me immortal? Tell me, venerable Sir, of that alone 
which you know to be the only means of attaining 
Immortality." 


4 


Yajnavalkya replied: "My dear, you have been my beloved 
even before and now you say what is after my heart. Come, sit 
down; I will explain it to you. As I explain it, meditate on what 
I say." 


5 


Then Yajnavalkya said: "Verily, not for the sake of the 
husband, my dear, is the husband loved, but he is loved for the 
sake of the self which, in its true nature, is one with the 
Supreme Self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the wife, my dear, is the wife loved, 
but she is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons 
loved, hut they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of wealth, my dear, is wealth loved, 
but it is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the brahmin, my dear, is the 
brahmin loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the kshatriya, my dear, is the 
kshatriya loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. 
"Verily, not for the sake of the worlds, my dear, are the worlds 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the gods, my dear, are the gods 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the beings, my dear, are the beings 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the All, my dear, is the All loved, 
but it is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, my dear Maitreyi, it is the Self that should be 
realized—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. 
By the realization of the Self, my dear—through hearing, 
reflection and meditation—all this is known. 


6 
"The brahmin rejects one who knows him as different from the 


Self. The kshatriya rejects one who knows him as different 


 


from the Self. The worlds reject one who knows them as 
different from the Self. The gods reject one who knows them as 
different from the Self. The beings reject one who knows them 
as different from the Self. The All rejects one who knows it as 
different from the Self. This brahmin, this kshatriya, these 
worlds, these gods, these beings and this All—are that Self. 


7—9 


"As the various particular kinds of notes of a drum, when it is 
beaten, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped only 
when the general note of the drum or the general sound 
produced by different kinds of strokes is grasped; 

"And as the various particular notes of a conch, when it is 
blown, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped only 
when the general note of the conch or the general sound 
produced by different kinds of blowing is grasped; 

"And as the various particular notes of a vina, when it is 
played, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped Only 
when the general note of the vina or the general sound 
produced by different kinds of playing is grasped; 

Similarly, no particular objects are perceived in the waking and 
dream states apart from Pure Intelligence. 


10 


"As from a fire kindled with wet fuel various kinds of smoke 
issue forth, even so, my dear, the Rig—Veda, the Yajur—vVeda, 
the Sama—Veda, the Atharvangirasa, history (itihasa), 
mythology (purana), the arts (vidya), the Upanishads, verses 
(slokas), aphorisms (sutras), elucidations (anuvyakhyanas) and 
explanations (vyakhyanas) are like the breath of this infinite 
Reality. From this Supreme Self are all these, indeed, breathed 
forth. 


11 


"As the ocean is the one goal of all waters (i.e. the place where 
they merge), so the skin is the one goal of all kinds of touch, 
the nostrils are the one goal of all smells, the tongue is the one 
goal of all savours, the ear is the one goal of all sounds, the 
mind is the one goal of all deliberations, the intellect is the one 
goal of all forms of knowledge, the hands are the one goal of all 
actions, the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of 
enjoyment, the excretory organ is the one goal of all excretions, 
the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking, the organ of 
speech is the one goal of all the Vedas. 


 


12 


"As a lump of salt dropped into water becomes dissolved in 
water and cannot be taken out again, but wherever we taste the 
water it tastes salt, even so, my dear, this great, endless, infinite 
Reality is Pure Intelligence alone. This self comes out as a 
separate entity from these elements and with their destruction 
this separate existence also is destroyed. After attaining 
oneness it has no more consciousness. This is what I say, my 
dear." 

So said Yajnavalkya. 


13 


Then Maitreyi said: "Just here you have bewildered me, 
venerable Sir, by saying that after attaining oneness the self has 
no more consciousness." 

Yajnavalkya replied: "Certainly I am not saying anything 
bewildering, my dear. This Reality is enough for knowledge, O 
Maitreyi." 


14 


"For when there is duality, as it were, then one smells another, 
one sees another, one hears another, one speaks to another, one 
thinks of another, one knows another. But when everything has 
become the Self, then what should one smell and through what, 
what should one see and through what, what should one hear 
and through what, what should one speak and through what, 
what should one think and through what, what should one 
know and through what? Through what should One know That 
owing to which all this is known—through what, my dear, 
should one know the Knower?"

And verily this Self is the Ruler of all beings, the King of all

organs and all these individual creatures fixed in this Self. 


16 


This, verily, is the honey (madhu—doctrine) which Dadhyach, 
versed in the Atharva—Veda, taught the Asvins. The Mantra 
(the rishi) perceived this and said: 

"O Asvins in human form, I will disclose that terrible deed of 
yours, called damsa, which you performed out of greed, as the 
thunder—cloud discloses the approaching rain. I will disclose 
the honey (madhu—doctrine), which Dadhyach, versed in the 
Atharva—Veda, taught you through the head of a horse." 


 


17 


This, verily, is the honey (madhu—doctrine) which Dadhyach, 
versed in the Atharva—Veda, taught the Asvins. The Mantra 
(the rishi) perceived this and said: 

"O Asvins, you fixed a horse's head on Dadhyach, versed in the 
Atharva—Veda, who, O terrible ones, wishing to be true to his 
promise, taught you the ritualistic meditation on the honey 
(madhu—doctrine) connected with the sun and also the secret 
(spiritual) meditation on it."

This, verily, is the honey (madhu—doctrine) which Dadhyach, 
versed in the Atharva—Veda, taught the Asvins. The Mantra

"He (the Lord) made bodies with two feet; He made bodies 
with four feet. Having first become a bird (the subtle body), He, 
the Supreme Person, entered the bodies. On account of His 
dwelling in all bodies (pur), He is called the Person (Purusha). 
There is nothing that is not covered by Him, nothing that is not 
pervaded by Him." 


19 


This, verily, is the honey (madhu—doctrine) which Dadhyach, 
versed in the Atharva—Veda, taught the Asvins. The Mantra 
(the rishi) perceived this and said: 

"He (the Lord) transformed Himself in accordance with each 
form and each form of His was for the sake of making Him 
known. The Lord (Indra), through His mayas, appears 
manifold; for to Him are yoked ten horses, nay, hundreds. "This 
Atman is the organs; It is ten and thousands—many and 
infinite. This Brahman is without antecedent or consequent, 
without interior or exterior. This self, the all—perceiving, is 
Brahman. This is the teaching of the Upanishads."

Part Three 

Chapter I—Yajnavalkya and Asvala 

1 

Om. Janaka, Emperor of Videha, performed a sacrifice in 
which gifts were freely distributed among the priests. Brahmin 
scholars from the countries of Kuru and Panchala were 


assembled there. Emperor Tanaka of Videha wished to know 
which of these brahmins was the most erudite Vedic scholar. 


 


So he confined a thousand cows in a pen and fastened on the 
horns of each ten padas of gold. 


2 


He said to them: "Venerable brahmins, let him among you who 
is the best Vedic scholar drive these cows home." 

None of the brahmins dared. Then Yajnavalkya said to one of 
his pupils: "Dear Samsrava, drive these cows home." He drove 
them away. 

The brahmins were furious and said: "How does he dare to call 
himself the best Vedic scholar among us?" 

Now among them there was Asvala, the hotri priest of Emperor 
Janaka of Videha. He asked Yajnavalkya: "Are you indeed the 
best Vedic scholar among us, O Yajnavalkya?" 

He replied: "I bow to the best Vedic scholar, but I just wish to 
have these cows." 

Thereupon the hotri Asvala determined to question him. 


3 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "since everything here (1.e. connected 
with the sacrifice) is overtaken by death, since everything is 
overcome by death, by what means does the sacrificer free 
himself from the reach of death?" 

"Through the hotri priest and the organ of speech looked upon 
as fire. The sacrificer's organ of speech is the hotri. This organ 
of speech is fire; this fire is the hotri; this fire is the means 

to liberation; this is complete liberation." 


4 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "since everything here is overtaken by 
day and night, since everything is overcome by day and night, 
by what means does the sacrificer free himself from the reach 
of day and night?" 

"Through the adhvaryu priest and the eye looked upon as the 
sun. The sacrificer's eye is the adhvaryu. This eye is the sun. 
This sun is the adhvaryu; this sun is the means to liberation; 
this is complete liberation." 


5 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "since everything here is overtaken by 
the bright and dark fortnights, since everything is overcome by 
the bright and dark fortnights, by what means does the 
sacrificer free himself from the reach of the bright and dark 
fortnights?" 

"Through the udgatri priest and the vital breath looked upon as 
the air. This vital breath is the udgatri. This vital breath is the 


 


air; this air is the udgatri; this air is the means to liberation; this 
is complete liberation." 


6 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "since the sky is, as it were, without a 
support, by means of what support does the sacrificer go to 
heaven?" 

"Through the Brahma priest and the mind looked upon as the 
moon. The sacrificer's mind is the Brahma. The mind is the 
moon; this moon is the Brahma; this moon is the means to 
liberation; this is complete liberation. 

So far about the ways of liberation; now about the meditation 
based upon resemblance. 


7 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "how many kinds of Rig verses will the 
hotri priest use today in this sacrifice?" 

"Three kinds." 

"And which are these three?" 

"The introductory, the sacrificial and the eulogistic as the 
third." 

"What does he (the sacrificer) win through them?" 

"All this that has life." 


8 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "how many kinds of oblations will the 
adhvaryu priest offer today in this sacrifice?" 

"Three." 

"And which are these three?" 

"Those which, when offered, blaze upward; those which, when 
offered, make a great noise; and those which, when offered, 
sink down." 

"What does he (the sacrificer) win through them?" 

"By those which, when offered, blaze upward, he wins the 
world of the gods; for the world of the gods shines bright, as it 
were. By those which, when offered, make a great noise, he 
wins the world of the Manes; for this world of the Manes is 
excessively noisy. By those which, when offered, sink down, 
he wins the world of men; for the world of men is down 
below." 


9 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "with how many gods does the Brahma 
priest seated on the right protect the sacrifice today?" 


"With one." 
"Which is that one?" 


 


"The mind. The mind is indeed infinite and infinite are the 
Visve—devas. An infinite world he (the sacrificer) wins 
thereby." 


10 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "how many kinds of hymns of praise 
will the udgatri priest chant today in this sacrifice?" 

"And which are these three?" 

"The introductory, the sacrificial and the eulogistic "Which are 
those that have reference to the body?" "The prana is the 
introductory hymn, the apana is hymn and the vyana is the 
eulogistic hymn." 

"What does he (the sacrificer) win through them?" 

"Through the introductory hymn he wins the earth, through the 
sacrificial hymn he wins the sky and through the eulogistic 
hymn he wins heaven. 

Thereupon the priest Asvala held his peace. 


Chapter II—Yajnavalkya and Artabhaga 
1 


Then Artabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, questioned him. 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "how many grahas (organs) are there 
and how many atigrahas (objects)?" 

"Eight grahas," he replied, "and eight atigrahas." 

"And which are these eight grahas and eight atigrahas?" 


2 

"The Prana (the nose), indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by 
the apana (odour), the atigraha; for one smells odours through 
apana (the air breathed in). 

3 

"The vak (the organ of speech), indeed, is the graha; it is 
controlled by the atigraha, name; for one utters names through 
the organ of speech. 


4 


"The tongue, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the 
atigraha, taste; for one knows tastes by the tongue. 


 


5 


"The eye, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha 
colour; for one sees colours through the eye. 


6 


"The ear, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha 
sound; for one hears sounds with the ear. 


7 


"The mind, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha 
desire; for through the mind one cherishes desires. 


8 


"The hands, indeed, are the graha; they are controlled by the 
atigraha, work; for one performs work by means of the hands. 


9 


"The skin, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha, 
touch; for one feels touch through the skin. These are the eight 
grahas and eight atigrahas." 


10 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "since all this is the food of death, who, 
pray, is that god to whom death is the food?" 

"Fire, indeed, is death; it is the food of water. One who knows 
this conquers further death." 


11 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "when this liberated person dies, do his 
organs depart from him or not?" 

"No," replied Yajnavalkya, "they merge in him only. The body 
swells, is inflated and in that state the dead body lies at rest." 


12 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "when such a man dies, what is it that 
does not leave him?" 


"The name. For the name is infinite and infinite are the Visve— 
devas. He who knows this wins thereby an infinite world." 


 


13 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "when the vocal organ of this dead 
person merges in fire, the nose in air, the eye in the sun, the 
mind in the moon, the ear in the quarters, the body in the earth, 
the akasa (space) in the heart in the external akasa, the hair on 
the body in the herbs, the hair on the head in the trees and the 
blood and semen are deposited in water, where is that person 
then?" 

Yajnavalkya said: "Give me your hand, dear Artabhaga. We 
shall decide this between ourselves; we cannot do it ina 
crowd." 

Then they went out and deliberated and what they talked about 
was karma (work) and what they praised was karma: one 
becomes good through good karma and evil through evil 
karma. 

Thereupon Artabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, held his peace. 


Chapter I1I—Yajnavalkya and Bhujyu 
1 


Next Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, questioned him. 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "we were travelling in the country of 
Madra as religious students, when we came to the house of 
Patanchala, of the line of Kapi. His daughter was possessed by 
a gandharva. 

We asked him: 'Who are you?' He said: 'I am Sudhanvan, of the 
line of Angiras.' While asking him about the limits of the 
world, we said: 'Where were the descendants of Parikshit?' And 
likewise I ask you, Yajnavalkya, where were the descendants of 
Parikshit? Tell me, where were the descendants of Parikshit?" 


2 


Yajnavalkya said: "The gandharva, I suppose, told you that 
they went where those who perform the Horse—sacrifice go." 
"And where do they go who have performed the Horse— 
sacrifice?" 

"Thirty—two times the space traversed by the sun's chariot in a 
day makes this plane (loka); around it, covering twice the area, 
is the world (prithivi); around the world, covering twice the 
area, is the ocean. Now, as is the edge of a razor or the wing of 
a fly, so is there just that much space between the two halves of 
the cosmic shell. Through that opening they go out. "Fire, in 
the form of a falcon, delivered them to Vayu. Vayu, placing 
them in itself, took them where previous performers of the 
Horse—sacrifice were." 

Thus did the gandharva praise Vayu. Therefore Vayu alone is 
the aggregate of all individuals. He who knows this, as stated 


 


above, conquers further death. 
Thereupon Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, held his peace. 


Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Ushasta 
1 


Then Ushasta, the son of Chakra, questioned him. 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "explain to me the Brahman that is 
immediately and directly perceived—the self that is within 
all." 

"This is your self that is within all." 

"Which self is within all, Yajnavalkya?" 

"That which breathes through the prana is your self that is 
within all. That which moves downward through the apana is 
your self that is within all. That which pervades through the 
vyana is your self that is within all. That which goes out with 
the udana is your self that is within all. This is your self that is 
within all." 


2 


Ushasta, the son of Chakra, said: "You have explained it as one 
might say: 'Such is a cow,' 'Such is a horse.' Tell me precisely 
the Brahman that is immediate and direct—the self that is 
within all." 

"This is your self that is within all." 

"Which is within all, Yajnavalkya?" 

"You cannot see the seer of seeing; you cannot hear the hearer 
of hearing; you cannot think of the thinker of thinking; you 
cannot know the knower of knowing. This is your self that is 
within all; everything else but this is perishable." 

Thereupon Ushasta, the son of Chakra, held his peace. 


Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Kahola 
1 


Next Kahola, the son of Kushitaka, questioned him. 
"Yajnavalkya," said he, "explain to me the Brahman that is 
directly and immediately perceived—the self that is within 
all." 

"This is your self that is within all." 

"Which self is within all, Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is that which transcends hunger and thirst, grief, delusion, 
old age and death. Having realized this Self, brahmins give up 
the desire for sons, the desire for wealth and the desire for the 
worlds and lead the life of religious mendicants. That which is 
the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is the 
desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds; for both these are 


 


but desires. 

Therefore a brahmin, after he is done with scholarship, should 
try to live on that strength which comes of scholarship. After he 
is done with that strength and scholarship, he becomes 
meditative and after he is done with both meditativeness and 
non—meditativeness, he becomes a knower of Brahman. 

"How does the knower of Brahman behave? Howsoever he 
may behave, he is such indeed. 

Everything else but this is perishable." 

Thereupon Kahola, the son of Kushitaka, held his peace. 


Chapter VI—Yajnavalkya and Gargi (I) 
1 


Then Gargi, the daughter of Vachaknu, questioned him. 
"Yajnavalkya ," said she, "if all this is pervaded by water, by 
what, pray, is water pervaded?" 

"By air, O Gargi." 

"By what, pray, is air pervaded?" 

"By the sky, O Gargi." 

"By what is the sky pervaded?" 

"By the world of the gandharvas, O Gargi." 

"By what is the world of the gandharvas pervaded?" 

"By the world of the sun, O Gargi. 

"By what is the world of the sun pervaded?" 

"By the world of the moon, O Gargi." 

"By what is the world of the moon pervaded?" 

"By the world of the stars, O Gargi." 

"By what is the world of the stars pervaded?" 

"By the world of the gods, O Gargi." 

"By what is the world of the gods pervaded?" 

"By the world of Indra, O Gargi. 

"By what is the world of Indra pervaded?" 

"By the World of Virij, O Gargi. 

"By what is the World of Virij pervaded?" 

"By the World of Hiranyagarbha, O Gargi." 

"By what, pray, is the World of Hiranyagarbha pervaded?" 
"Do not, O Gargi," said he, "question too much, lest your head 
should fall off. You are questioning too much about a deity 
about whom we should not ask too much. Do not ask too much, 
O Gargi." 

Thereupon Gargi, the daughter of Vachaknu, held her peace. 


Chapter VII—Yajnavalkya and Uddalaka 
1 
Then Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, questioned him. 


"Yajnavalkya," said he, "in the country of Madra we lived in 


 


the house of Patanchala, of the line of Kapi, studying the 
scriptures on the sacrifices. His wife was possessed by a 
gandharva. We asked him: "Who are you?' He said: 'I am 
Kabandha, the son of Atharvan.' He said to Patanchala 

Kapya and those studying the scriptures on the sacrifices: 'O 
descendant of Kapi, do you know that Sutra by which this 
world, the other world and all beings are held together?' 
Patanchala Kapya said: 'I do not know it, venerable Sir.' Then 
he said to Patanchala Kapya and those studying the scriptures 
on the sacrifices: 'O descendant of Kapi, do you know that 
Inner Controller who controls this world, the next world and all 
beings?' Patanchala Kapya said: 'I do not know him, venerable 
Sir.' Then he said to Patanchala Kapya and those studying the 
scriptures on the sacrifices: 'O descendant of Kapi, he who 
knows that Sutra and that Inner Controller indeed knows 
Brahman; he knows the worlds, he knows the gods, he knows 
the Vedas, he knows the beings, he knows the self, he 

knows everything.' He explained it all to them and I know it. If 
you, Yajnavalkya, do not know that Sutra and that Inner 
Controller and still take away the cows that belong only to the 
knowers of Brahman, your head will fall off." 

"I know, O Gautama, that Sutra and that Inner Controller." 
"Anyone might say: 'I know, I know.' Tell us what you know." 


2 


Yajnavalkya said: "Vayu, O Gautama, is that Sutra. By Vayu, 
as by a thread, O Gautama, are this world, the other world and 
all beings held together. Therefore, O Gautama, they say of a 
person who dies that his limbs have been loosened; for they are 
held together by Vayu as by a thread." 

"Quite so, Yajnavalkya. Now describe the Inner Controller." 


3 


Yajnavalkya said: "He who inhabits the earth, yet is within the 
earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is 
and who controls the earth from within—He is your Self, the 
Inner Controller, the Immortal. 


4—14 


"He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does 
not know, whose body water is and who controls water from 
within—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 
"He who inhabits fire, yet is within fire, whom fire does not 
know, whose body fire is and who controls fire from within 
—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the sky, yet is within the sky, whom the sky 
does not know, whose body the sky is and who controls the sky 


 


from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. "He who 
inhabits the air, yet is within the air, whom the air does not 
know, whose body the air is and who controls the air from 
within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits heaven, yet is within heaven, whom heaven 
does not know, whose body heaven is and who controls heaven 
from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun 
does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun 
from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the quarters of space, yet is within them, 
whom the quarters do not know, whose 

body the quarters are and who controls the quarters from within 
—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the moon and stars, yet is within the moon 
and stars, whom the moon and stars do not know, whose body 
the moon and stars are and who controls the moon and stars 
from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the akasa, yet is within the akasa, whom the 
akasa does not know, whose body the akasa is and who controls 
the akasa from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits darkness, yet is within darkness, whom 
darkness does not know, whose body darkness is and who 
controls darkness from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits light, yet is within light, whom light does not 
know, whose body light is and who controls light from within 
—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal." 

This much with reference to the gods (adhidaivatam). Now 
with reference to beings (adhibhutam). 


15 


Yajnavalkya said: "He who inhabits all beings, yet is within all 
beings, whom no beings know, whose body all beings are and 
who controls all beings from within—He is your Self, the 
Inner Controller, the Immortal." 

This much with reference to the beings. Now with reference to 
the body. 


16 
Yajnavalkya said: "He who inhabits the nose (prana), yet is 


within the nose, whom the nose does not know, whose body the 


 


nose is and who controls the nose from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the organ of speech, yet is within speech, 
whom speech does not know, whose body speech is and who 
controls speech from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the eye, yet is within the eye, whom the eye 
does not know, whose body the eye is and who controls the eye 
from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.

does not know, whose body the ear is and who controls the ear 
from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.

"He who inhabits the skin, yet is within the skin, whom the skin 
does not know, whose body the skin is and who controls the 
skin from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the intellect (vijnana), yet is within the 
intellect, whom the intellect does not know, whose body the 
intellect is and who controls the intellect from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He who inhabits the organ of generation, yet is within the 
organ, whom the organ does not know, whose body the organ is 
and who controls the organ from within 

—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 

"He is never seen, but is the Seer; He is never heard, but is the 
Hearer; He is never thought of, but is the Thinker; He is never 
known, but is the Knower. There is no other seer than He, there 
is no other hearer than He, there is no other thinker than He, 
there is no other knower than He. He is your Self, the Inner 
Controller, the Immortal. Everything else but Him is 
perishable." 

Thereupon Uddilaka, the son of Aruna, held his peace. 


Chapter VIII—Yajnavalkya and Gargi (II) 

1 

Then the daughter of Vachaknu said: "Venerable brahmins, I 
shall ask him two questions. If he answers me these, then none 


of you can defeat him in discussing Brahman." 
The brahmins said: "Ask, O Gargi." 


 


2 


Gargi said: "O Yajnavalkya, I shall ask you two questions: 

As a man of Kasi or the King of Videha, scion of a heroic line, 
might string his unstrung bow, take in his hand two bamboo— 
tipped arrows highly painful to enemies and approach his 
enemies closely, even so, O Yajnavalkya, do I confront you 
with two questions. Answer me these." 

"Ask, O Gargi." 


3 


She said: "O Yajnavalkya, what pervades that Sutra which is 
above heaven and below the earth, which is heaven and earth as 
well as what is between them and which—they say—was, is 
and will be?" 


4 


He said: "That, O Gargi, which is above heaven and below the 
earth, which is heaven and earth as well as what is between 
them and which—they say—was, is and will be, is pervaded by 
the unmanifested akasa. 


5 


She said: "I bow to you, O Yajnavalkya. You have fully 
answered this question of mine. Now brace yourself for the 
other." 

"Ask, O Gargi." 


6—7 


She said: "Yajnavalkya, what pervades that Sutra which is 
above heaven and below the earth, which is heaven and earth as 
well as what is between them and which—they say—was, is 
and will be?" 

He said: "That, O Gargi, which is above heaven and below the 
earth, which is heaven and earth as well as what is between 
them and which—they say—was, is and will be, is pervaded by 
the unmanifested akasa." 

"What pervades the akasa?" 


8 


He said: "That, O Gargi, the knowers of Brahman call the 
Imperishable. It is neither gross nor subtle, neither short nor 
long, neither red nor moist; It is neither shadow nor darkness, 
neither air nor akasa; It is unattached; It is without taste or 
smell, without eyes or ears, without tongue or mind; It is non— 


 


effulgent, without vital breath or mouth, without measure and 
without exterior or interior. It does not eat anything, nor is It 
eaten by anyone. 


9 


"Verily, under the mighty rule of this Imperishable, O Gargi, 
the sun and moon are held in their respective positions. Under 
the mighty rule of this Imperishable, O Gargi, heaven and earth 
are held in their respective positions. Under the mighty rule of 
this Imperishable, O Gargi, moments, muhurtas (about forty— 
eight minutes), days and nights, fortnights, months, seasons and 
years are held in their respective positions. Under the mighty 
rule of this Imperishable, O Gargi, some rivers flow eastward 
from the white mountains, others flowing westward continue in 
that direction and still others keep to their respective courses. 
Under the mighty rule of this Imperishable, O Gargi, men 
praise those who give, the gods depend upon the sacrificer and 
the Manes upon the Darvi offering. 


10 


"Whosoever in this world, O Gargi, without knowing this 
Imperishable, offers oblations, performs sacrifices and practises 
austerities, even for many thousands of years, finds all such 
acts but perishable. Whosoever, O Gargi, departs from this 
world without knowing this Imperishable is miserable. But he, 
O Gargi, who departs from this world after knowing the 
Imperishable is a knower of Brahman. 


11 


"Verily, that Imperishable, O Gargi, is never seen but is the 
Seer; It is never heard, but is the Hearer; It is never thought of, 
but is the Thinker; It is never known, but is the Knower. There 
is no other seer but This, there is no other hearer but This, there 
is no other thinker but This, there is no other knower but This. 
By this imperishable, O Gargi, is the unmanifested akasa 
pervaded." 


12 


Then said Gargi: "Venerable brahmins, you may consider 
yourselves fortunate if you can get off from him through 
bowing to him. None of you, I believe, will defeat him in 
arguments about Brahman. 

Thereupon the daughter of Vachaknu held her peace. 


 


Chapter IX—Yajnavalkya and Vidaghdha 
1 


Then Vidaghdha, the son of Sakala, asked him: "How many 
gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

Yajnavalkya ascertained the number through the group of 
mantras known as the Nivid and said: 

"As many as are mentioned in the Nivid of the Visve—devas— 
three hundred and three and three 

thousand and three." 

"Very good," said Sakalya (the son of Sakala) and asked again: 
"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"Thirty—three." 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked again: 

"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"SDL, 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked again: 

"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"Three. 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked again: 

"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"Two." 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked again: 

"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"One and a half." 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked again: 

"How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?" 

"One." 

"Very good," said Sakalya and asked: 

"Which are those three hundred and three and those three 
thousand and three?" 


2 


Yajnavalkya said: "There are only thirty—three gods. These 
others are but manifestations of them." 

"Which are these thirty—three?" 

"The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras and the twelve Adityas— 
these are thirty—one. And Indra and 

Prajapati make up the thirty—three."" 


3 


"Which are the Vasus?" asked Sakalya. 

"Fire, the earth, the air, the sky, the sun, heaven, the moon and 
the stars—these are the Vasus; for in 

them all this universe is placed (vasavah). Therefore they are 
called Vasus. 


 


4 


"Which are the Rudras?" asked Sakalya. 

"The ten organs in the human body, with the mind as the 
eleventh. When they depart from this 

mortal body, they make one's relatives weep. Because they 
make them weep (rud), therefore they 

are called Rudras. 


5 


"Which are the Adityas?" asked Sakalya. 

"There are twelve months in the year. These are the Adityas, 
because they move along carrying 

(adadanah) all this with them; therefore they are called 
Adityas." 


6 


"Which is Indra and which is Prajapati?" asked Sakalya. 
"The thunderclap is Indra and the sacrifice is Prajapati." 
"Which is the thunderclap?" 

"The thunderbolt." 

"Which is the sacrifice?" 

"The animals." 


7 


"Which are the six gods?" asked Sakalya. 
"Fire, the earth, the air, the sky, the sun and heaven; for these 
six comprise all those." 


8 


"Which are the three gods?" asked Sakalya. 

"These three worlds, because all those gods are comprised in 
these three." 

"Which are the two gods?" 

"Matter and the vital breath (prana)." 

"Which are the one and a half?" 

"This air that blows." 


9 


Yajnavalkya said: "Concerning this some say: 'Since the air 
blows as one substance, how can it be 

one and a half (adhyardha)?' The answer is: It is one and a half 
because by its presence everything 

attains surpassing glory (adhyardhnot)." 

"Which is the one God?" 


 


"The vital breath (Hiranyagarbha); it is Brahman which is 
called That (Tyat)." 


10 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is the earth, whose organ of vision 

is fire, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate support 
of the body and organs in their 

entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is in this body. Go on, Sakalya." 
"Who is His deity (cause)?" 

"Nectar (chyle)," said Yajnavalkya. 


11 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is lust (kama), whose organ of 

vision is the intellect, whose light is the mind and who is the 
ultimate support of the body and 

organs in their entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 
"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is identified with lust. Go on, 
Sakalya." 

"Who is His deity?" 

"Women," said Yajnavalkya. 


12 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is colours, whose organ of vision is 

the eye, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate support 
of the body and organs in their 

entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is in the sun. Go on, Sakalya." 
"Who is His deity?" 

"Truth (the eye)," said Yajnavalkya. 


13 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is the akasa, whose organ of vision 

is the ear, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 


 


"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is identified with the ear and with 
the time of hearing. Go on, Sakalya." 

"Who is His deity?" 

"The quarters," said Yajnavalkya. 


14 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is darkness, whose organ of vision 

is the intellect, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in 

their entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is identified with shadow 
(ignorance). Go on, Sakalya." 

"Who is His deity?" 

"Death," said Yajnavalkya. 


15 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is particular colours, whose organ 

of vision is the eye, whose light is the mind and who is the 
ultimate support of the body and organs 

in their entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the being who is in the mirror. Go on, Sakalya." 
"Who is His deity?" 

"The vital breath," said Yajnavalkya. 


16 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is water, whose organ of vision is 

the intellect, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is in water. Go on, Sakalya." 
"Who is His deity?" 

"Varuna (rain)," said Yajnavalkya. 


 


17 


Sakalya said: "Verily, whosoever knows that Being whose 
body is semen, whose organ of vision is 

the intellect, whose light is the mind and who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety, he indeed knows, O Yajnavalkya." 

"I know that Being of whom you speak—who is the ultimate 
support of the body and organs in their 

entirety. It is the Being who is identified with the son. Go on, 
Sakalya." 

"Who is His deity?" 

"Prajapati (the father)," said Yajnavalkya. 


18 


When Sakalya kept silent Yajnavalkya addressed him thus: 
"Sakalya, have these brahmins made you their instrument such 
as tongs for burning charcoal?" 


19—20 


"Yajnavalkya," said Sakalya, "what Brahman do you know, 
that you have thus flouted these Vedic 

scholars of Kuru and Panchala?" 

Yajnavalkya replied: "I know the quarters, with their deities 
and supports." 

Sakalya said: "If you know the quarters, with their deities and 
supports, what deity are you 

identified with in the east?" 

"With the deity sun." 

"In what does the sun find its support?" 

"The eye. 

"In what does the eye find its support?" 

"Colours, for one sees colours with the eye." 

"In what do colours find their support?" 

"The heart (mind)," said Yajnavalkya, "for one knows colours 
through the heart. Therefore it is in 

the heart that colours find their support." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


21 


"Yajnavalkya," said Sakalya, "what deity are you identified 
with in the south?" 

"With the deity Yama (the god of justice)." 

"In what does Yama find his support?" 

"The sacrifice." 

"In what does the sacrifice find its support?" 

"The remuneration of the priests." 


 


"In what does the remuneration find its support?" 

"Faith, for when a man has faith he remunerates the priest. 
Therefore it is in faith that the 

remuneration finds its support." 

"In what does faith find its support?" 

"The heart (mind)," said Yajnavalkya, "for one knows faith 
through the heart. Therefore it is in the 

heart that faith finds its support." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


22 


"Yajnavalkya," said Sakalya, "what deity are you identified 
with in the west?" 

"With the deity Varuna (the god of rain)." 

"In what does Varuna find his support?" 

"Water." 

"In what does water find its support?" 

"Semen." 

"In what does semen find its support?" 

"The heart," said Yajnavalkya. "Therefore they say of a new— 
born child who resembles his father 

that it seems as if he has sprung from his father's heart—that he 
has been created of his father's 

heart, as it were. Therefore it is in the heart that semen finds its 
support." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


23 


"Yajnavalkya," said Sakalya, "what deity are you identified 
with in the north?" 

"With the deity Soma (the moon and the creeper of that name)." 
"In what does Soma find its support?" 

"The initiatory rite." 

"In what does initiation find its support?" 

"Truth. Therefore they say to the one who is initiated: 'Speak 
the truth'; for it is in the truth that 

initiation finds its support." 

"In what does the truth find its support?" 

"The heart," said Yajnavalkya, "for through the heart one 
knows the truth; therefore it is in the heart 

that the truth finds its support." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


24 
"What deity," said Sakalya, "are you identified with in the fixed 


direction (i.e. overhead)?" 
"With the deity fire." 


 


"In what does fire find its support?" 
"Speech." 

"In what does speech find its support?" 
"The heart." 

"In what does the heart find its support?" 


25 


"You ghost," said Yajnavalkya, "that you think that the heart 
should be elsewhere than in ourselves! 

If it were elsewhere than in ourselves, dogs would eat this body 
or birds tear it to pieces." 


26 


"In what do the body and the heart find their support?" asked 
Sakalya. 

"In the prana." 

"In what does the prana find its support?" 

"In the apana." 

"In what does the apana find its support?" 

"In the vyana." 

"In what does the vyana find its support?" 

"In the udana."" 

"In what does the udana find its support?" 

"In the samana." 

Here the Upanishad itself states: 

This self is That which has been described as "Not this, not 
this." 

It is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, for It 
never decays; unattached, for It is 

never attached; unfettered, for It never feels pain and never 
suffers injury. 

Yajnavalkya said: "These are the eight abodes, the eight organs 
of vision, the eight deities and the 

eight beings. 

"Now I ask you about that Person who is to be known only 
from the Upanishads, who definitely 

projects those beings and again withdraws them into Himself 
and who is at the same time 

transcendental. 

"If you cannot clearly explain Him to me, your head shall fall 
off?' Sakalya did not know Him; his 

head fell off; and robbers snatched away his bones, mistaking 
them for something else. 


27 
Then Yajnavalkya said: "Venerable brahmins, whosoever 


among you wishes to question me may 


 


now do so, or all of you may. Or whosoever among you desires 
it, I shall question him, or I shall 

question all of you. 

But the brahmins did not dare. 


28 
Yajnavalkya interrogated them with the following verses: 


1. Asis a mighty tree, so indeed is a man: this is true. His 
hairs are the leaves and his skin is the outer bark. 

2. From his skin blood flows and from the bark, sap. 
Therefore when a man is Wounded blood flows, as sap 
from a tree that is injured. 

3. His flesh is its inner bark and his nerves are its 
innermost layer of bark, which is tough. His bones lie 
within, as does the wood of the tree. His marrow 
resembles the pith. 

4. A tree, when it is felled, springs again from its root in a 
new form; from what root, tell me, does a man spring 
forth after he is cut off by death? 

5. Do not say: From the semen, for that is produced from 
the living man. A tree springs from the seed as well; 
after it is dead it certainly springs again. 

6. Ifa tree is pulled up with its root, it will not spring 
again. From what root, tell me, does a mortal spring 
forth after he is cut off by death? 

7. Ifyou think he is indeed born, I say: No, he is born 
again. Now who should again bring him forth? 


The Upanishad states: It is Brahman, which is absolute 
Knowledge and Bliss, the ultimate goal of 

him who offers wealth and also of him who has realized 
Brahman and stands firm in It. 


Part Four 

Chapter I—Partial Definitions of Brahman 

1 

Om. Janaka, Emperor of Videha, was seated to give audience 
when Yajnavalkya arrived. The Emperor said to him: 
"Yajnavalkya, for what purpose have you come here? With a 


desire for cattle, or to hear some subtle questions asked?" 
"For both, Your Majesty," said he. 


 


2 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you." 

"Jitvan, the son of Silina, told me that the organ of speech (fire) 
is Brahman." 

"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the son of Silina 
say that the organ of speech is Brahman; for what can be 
attained by a person who cannot speak? But did he tell you 
about its abode (body) and support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The physical organ of speech is its abode and the akasa is its 
support. It should be mediated upon as intelligence." 

"What is intelligence, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"Tt is the organ of speech, Your Majesty," said Yajnavalkya. 
"Through the organ of speech alone, O Emperor, are known the 
Rig—Veda, the Yagur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, the 
Atharvangirasa, history, ancient lore, the arts, the Upanishads, 
verses, aphorisms, explanations, commentaries, the results of 
sacrifices, the result of offering oblations in the fire, the results 
of giving food and drink, this world, the next world and all 
beings. 

"The organ of speech, Your Majesty, is the Supreme Brahman. 
The organ of speech never deserts him who, knowing this, 
meditates upon it; all beings eagerly approach him; and being a 
god, he attains the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


a 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you." 

"Udanka, the son of Sulba, told me that the vital breath (prana) 
is Brahman." 

"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the son of Sulba 
say that the vital breath is Brahman; for what can be attained by 
a person who does not live? But did he tell you about its abode 
and support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The vital breath is its abode and the akasa is its support. It 


 


should be meditated upon as dear." 

"What is that dearness, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is the vital breath, Your Majesty," said Yajnavalkya. "For 
the sake of that vital breath (life), O Emperor, one performs 
sacrifices for him for whom they should not be performed and 
accepts gifts from him from whom they should not be accepted; 
nay, for the sake of the vital breath, O Emperor, one may go to 
a quarter where one runs the risk of losing one's life. 

"The vital breath, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman. The 
vital breath never deserts him who, knowing what has just been 
said, meditates upon it; all beings eagerly approach him; and 
being a god, he attains the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


4 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you. 

"Barku, the son of Vrishna, told me that the eye is Brahman." 
"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the son of Vrishna 
say that the eye is Brahman; for what can be attained by a 
person who cannot see? But did he tell you about its abode and 
support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The eye is its abode and the akasa is its support. It should be 
meditated upon as truth." 

"What is truth, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is the eye, Your Majesty," said Yajnavalkya. "Verily, Your 
Majesty, if one asks a person who has seen with his eyes: 
'Have you seen?' and he answers: 'Yes, I have,' then it is true. 
"The eye, Your Majesty, is the Supreme Brahman. The eye 
never deserts him who, knowing what has just been said, 
meditates upon it; all beings eagerly approach him; and being a 
god, he attains the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


 


5 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you." 

"Gardabhivipita, a descendant of Bharadvaja, told me that the 
ear is Brahman." 

"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the descendant of 
Bharadvaja say that the ear is Brahman; for what can be 
attained by a person who cannot hear? But did he tell you about 
its abode and support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The ear is its abode and the akasa is its support. It should be 
meditated upon as infinite." 

"What is infinity, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is the quarters, Your Majesty," said Yajnavalkya. "Verily, 
Your Majesty, to whatever quarter (direction) one may go, one 
never reaches its end. Hence the quarters are infinite. The 
quarters, O Emperor, are the ear and the ear, O Emperor, is the 
Supreme Brahman. 

"The ear never deserts him who, knowing this, meditates upon 
it; all beings eagerly approach him; and being a god, he attains 
the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


6 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you." 

"Satyakama, the son of Jabala, told me that the mind is 
Brahman." 

"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the son of Jaa say 
that the mind is Brahman; for what can be attained by a person 
who has no mind? But did he tell you about its abode and 
support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The mind is its abode and the akasa is its support. It should be 
meditated upon as bliss." 

"What is bliss, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is the mind, Your Majesty," said Yajnavdkya. "Verily, Your 
Majesty, with the mind a man desires and woos a woman; then 


 


a son resembling him is born of her and he is the cause of bliss. 
The mind, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman. 

"The mind never deserts him who, knowing this, meditates 
upon it; all beings eagerly approach him; and being a god, he 
attains the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


q 


Yajnavalkya said: "Let me hear what anyone among your 
teachers may have told you." 

"Vidaghdha, the son of Sakala, told me that the heart is 
Brahman." 

"As anyone who had the benefit of being taught by a good 
mother, father and teacher should say, so did the son of Sakala 
say that the heart is Brahman; for what can be attained by a 
person who is without a heart? But did he tell you about its 
abode and support?" 

"No, he did not." 

"This Brahman is only one—footed, Your Majesty." 

"Then you tell us, O Yajnavalkya." 

"The heart is its abode and the akasa is its support. It should be 
meditated upon as stability." 

"What is stability, O Yajnavalkya?" 

"It is the heart," said Yajnavalkya. "Verily, Your Majesty, the 
heart is the abode of all beings and the heart, Your Majesty, is 
the support of all beings. The heart, O Emperor, is the Supreme 
Brahman. 

"The heart never deserts him who, knowing this, meditates 
upon it; all beings eagerly approach him; and being a god, he 
attains the gods." 

"I give you a thousand cows with a bull as large as an 
elephant," said Emperor Janaka. 

Yajnavalkya replied: "My father was of the opinion that one 
should not accept gifts from a disciple without fully instructing 
him." 


Chapter II—Concerning The Self 

1 

Janaka, Emperor of Videha, rose from his lounge, humbly 
approached Yajnavalkya and said: "Salutation to you, O 
Yajnavalkya. Please instruct me." 


Yajnavalkya said: "Your Majesty, as one who wishes to go a 
long distance would procure a chariot or a ship, even so you 


 


have fully equipped your mind with so many secret names of 
Brahman. You are also honoured and wealthy; you have 
studied the Vedas and heard the Upanishads. But do you know 
where you will go when you are released from this body?" 
"Venerable Sir, I do not know where I shall go." 

"Then I will tell you where you will go." 

"Tell me, venerable Sir." 


2 


"The person who is in the right eye is named Indha. Though he 
is Indha, people call him by the indirect name Indra; for the 
gods are fond of indirect names and hate to be addressed 
directly. 


3 


"The person who is in the left eye is his wife, Viraj (matter). 
The akasa that lies within the heart is their place of union. Their 
food is the lump (pinda) of blood in the heart. Their wrap is the 
net—like structure in the heart. The path on which they move 
from sleep to waking is the nerve that goes upward from the 
heart; it is like a hair split into a thousand parts. In the body 
there are nerves called hita, which are placed in the heart. 
Through these the essence of our food passes as it moves on. 
Therefore the subtle body (Taijasa) receives finer food than the 
gross body (Vaisvanara). 


4 


"Of the illumined sage who is identified with Prajna in deep 
sleep the east is the eastern vital breath (prana), the south is the 
southern vital breath, the west is the western vital breath, the 
north is the northern vital breath, the upper direction is the 
upper vital breath, the direction below is the nether vital breath 
and all the directions are all the vital breaths. 

"This self is That which has been described as 'Not this, not 
this.' It is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, 
for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; 
unfettered, for It never feels pain and never suffers injury. 
"Verily, O Janaka, you have attained That which is free from 
fear," said Yajnavalkya. 

"Venerable Yajnavalkya," said Emperor Janaka, "may that 
fearless Brahman be yours too, for you have made known to us 
the fearless Brahman. Salutations to you! Here is the Empire of 
Videha and also myself at your service." 


 


Chapter I1I—Investigation of the Three States 
1 


Yajnavalkya called on Janaka, Emperor of Videha. He said to 
himself: "I will not say anything." 

But once upon a time Janaka, Emperor of Videha and 
Yajnavalkya had had a talk about the Agnihotra sacrifice and 
Yajnavalkya had offered him a boon. Janaka had chosen the 
right to ask him any questions he wished and Yajnavalkya had 
granted him the boon. 

So it was the Emperor who first questioned him. 


2 


"Yajnavalkya, what serves as light for a man?" 

"The light of the sun, O Emperor," said Yajnavalkya, "for with 
the sun as light he sits, goes out, works and returns." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


a 


"When the sun has set, Yajnavalkya, what serves as light for a 
man?" 

"The moon serves as his light, for with the moon as light he 
sits, goes out, works and returns." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


4 


"When the sun has set and the moon has set, Yajnavalkya, what 
serves as light for a man?" 

"Fire serves as his light, for with fire as light he sits, goes out, 
works and returns." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


5 


"When the sun has set, Yajnavalkya and the moon has set and 
the fire has gone out, what serves as light for a man?" 

"Speech (sound) serves as his light, for with speech as light he 
sits, goes out, works and returns. Therefore, Your Majesty, 
when one cannot see even one's own hand, yet when a sound is 
uttered, one can go there." 

"Just so, Yajnavalkya." 


6 


"When the sun has set, Yajnavalkya and the moon has set and 
the fire has gone out and speech has stopped, what serves as 


 


light for a man?" 
"The self, indeed, is his light, for with the self as light he sits, 
goes out, works and returns." 


2 


"Which is the self?" 

"This purusha which is identified with the intellect 
(vijnanamaya) and is in the midst of the orgams, the self— 
indulgent light within the heart (intellect). Assuming the 
likeness of the intellect, it wansers between the two worlds; it 
thinks, as it were and moves, as it were being indetified with 
dreasm, it trasncends this waking world, which represents the 
forms of death (ignorance and its effects). 


8 


"That person (the individual self), when he is born, that is to 
say, when he assumes a body, is joined with evils and when he 
dies, that is to say, leaves the body, he discards those evils. 


9 


"And there are only two states for that person: the one here in 
this world and the other in the next world. The third, the 
intermediate, is the dream state. When he is in that intermediate 
state, he surveys both states: the one here in this world and the 
other in the next world. Now, whatever support he may have 
for the next world, he provides himself with that and sees both 
evils (sufferings) and joys. 

"And when he dreams, he takes away a little of the impressions 
of this all—embracing world (the waking state), himself makes 
the body unconscious and creates a dream body in its place, 
revealing his own brightness by his own light—and he dreams. 
In this state the person becomes self—illumined. 


10 


"There are no real chariots in that state, nor animals to be yoked 
to them, nor roads there, but he creates the chariots, animals 
and roads. There are no pleasures in that state, no joys, no 
rejoicings, but he creates the pleasures, joys and rejoicings. 
There are no pools in that state, no reservoirs, no rivers, but he 
creates the pools, reservoirs and rivers. He indeed is the agent. 


11 
"Regarding this there are the following verses: 


'The effulgent infinite being (purusha), who travels alone, 
makes the body insensible in sleep but himself remains awake 


 


and taking with him the luminous particles of the organs, 
watches those which lie dormant. Again he comes to the 
waking state. 


12 


'The effulgent infinite being (purusha), who is immortal and 
travels alone, guards the unclean nest (body) with the help of 
the vital breath (prana) and himself moves out of the nest. That 
immortal entity wanders wherever he likes. 


13 


'In the dream world, the luminous one attains higher and lower 
states and creates many forms—now, as it were, enjoying 
himself in the company of women, now laughing, now even 
beholding frightful sights. 


14 


'Everyone sees his sport but him no one sees.' They say: 'Do 
not wake him suddenly.' If he does not find the right organ, the 
body becomes difficult to doctor. 


15 


Yajnavalkya said: "Tha entity (purusha), after enjoying himself 
and raoming in the dream state and merely witnessing the 
results of good and evil, remians in a state of profound sleep 
and then hastens back in the reverse way to his former 
condition, the dream state. He remains unaffected by whatever 
he sees in that dream state, for this infinite being is unattached." 
Janaka said: "Just so, Yajnavalkya. I give you, Sir, a thousand 
cows. 

Please instruct me further about Liberation itself. 


16 


"Yajnavalkya said: "That entity (purusha), after enjoying

Janaka said: "Just so, Yajnavalkya. I give you, Sir, a thousand 
COWS.

17 


Yajnavalkya said: "That entity (purusha), after enjoying 

himself and roaming in the waking state and merely witnessing 
the results of good and evil, hastens back in the reverse way to 
its former condition, the dream state or that of dreamless sleep. 


18 


"As a large fish swims alternately to both banks of a river—the 
east and the west—so does the infinite being move to both 
these states: dreaming and waking. 


19 


"As a hawk or a falcon roaming in the sky becomes tired, folds 
its wings and makes for its nest, so does this infinite entity 
(purusha) hasten for this state, where, falling asleep, he 
cherishes no more desires and dreams no more dreams. 


20 


"There are ni his body nerves (nadis) called hita, which are fine 
as a hair divided into a thousand parts and are filled with white, 
blue, brown, green and red fluids. Theyt are the seat of the 
suble body, which is the storehouse of impressions. Now, when 
he feels as if he were being killed or overpowered, or being 
chased by an elephant, or falling into a pit, in short, when he 
fancies at that time, thorough ignorance, whatever frightful 
thing he has expericned in the waking state, that is the dream 
state. So also, when he thinks he is a god, as it were, or a king, 
as it were, or thinks: "This universe is myself and I am all,: that 
is his highest state. 


21 


"That indeed is his form—free from desires, free from evils, 
free from fear. As a man fully embraced by his beloved wife 
knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within, so does 
this infinite being (the self), when fully embraced by the 
Supreme Self, know nothing that is without, nothing that is 
within. 

"That indeed is his form, in which all his desires are fulfilled, in 
which all desires become the self and which is free from desires 
and devoid of grief. 


22 
"In this state a father is no more a father, a mother is no more a 


mother, the worlds are no more the worlds, the gods are no 


 


more the gods, the Vedas are no more the Vedas. In this state a 
thief is no more a thief, the killer of a noble brahmin is no more 
a killer, a chandala is no more a chandala, a paulkasa is no 
more a paulkasa, a monk is no more a monk, an ascetic is no 
more an ascetic. 

"This form of his is untouched by good deeds and untouched by 
evil deeds, for he is then beyond all the woes of his heart. 


23 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not see, yet it is 
seeing though it does not see; for there is no cessation of the 
vision of the seer, because the seer is imperishable. There is 
then, however, no second thing separate from the seer that it 
could see. 


24 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not smell, yet it 
is smelling though it does not smell; for there is no cessation of 
the smelling of the smeller, because the smeller is imperishable. 
There is then, however, no second thing separate from the 
smeller that it could smell. 


25 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not taste, yet it 
is tasting though it does not taste; for there is no cessation of 
the tasting of the taster, because the taster is imperishable. 
There is then, however, no second thing separate from the taster 
that it could taste. 


26 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not speak, yet it 
is speaking though it does not speak; for there is no cessation of 
the speaking of the speaker, because the speaker is 
imperishable. There is then, however, no second thing separate 
from the speaker that it could speak about. 


27 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not hear, yet it 
is hearing though it does not hear; for there is no cessation of 
the hearing of the hearer, because the hearer is imperishable. 
There is then, however, no second thing separate from the 
hearer that it could hear. 


 


28 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not think, yet it 
is thinking though it does not think; for there is no cessation of 
the thinking of the thinker, because the thinker is imperishable. 
There is then, however, no second thing separate from the 
thinker that it could think of.

"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not touch, yet it 
is touching though it does not touch; for there is no cessation of 
the touching of the toucher, because the toucher is 
imperishable. There is then, however, no second thing separate 
from the toucher that it could touch. 


30 


"And when it appears that in deep sleep it does not know, yet it 
is knowing though it does not know; for there is no cessation of 
the knowing of the knower, because the knower is 
imperishable. There is then, however, no second thing separate 
from the knower that it could know. 


31 


"When in the waking and dream states there is, as it were, 
another, then one can see the other, then one can smell the 
other, then one can speak to the other, then one can hear the 
other, then one can think of the other, then one can touch the 
other, then one can know the other. 


32 


"In deep sleep it becomes transparent like water, the witness, 
one and without a second. This is the World of Brahman, Your 
Majesty. This is its supreme attainment, this is its supreme 
glory, this it its highest world, this is its supreme bliss. On a 
particle of this bliss other creatures live." 

Thus did Yajnavalkya teach Janaka. 


33 


"If a person is perfect of body and is prosperous, lord of others 
and most lavishly supplied with all human enjoyments, he 
represents the highest blessing among men. This human bliss 
multiplied a hundred times makes one measure of the bliss of 
the Manes who have won their own world. The bliss of these 
Manes who have won their world, multiplied a hundred times, 
makes one measure of bliss in the world of the gandharvas. The 


 


bliss of the gandharvas, multiplied a hundred times, makes one 
measure of the bliss of the gods by action (those who attain 
godhood through sacrificial rites). The bliss of the gods by 
action, multiplied a hundred times, makes one measure of the 
bliss of the gods by birth, as also of one who is versed in the 
Vedas, sinless and free from desire. The bliss of the gods by 
birth, multiplied a hundred times, makes one measure of bliss 
in the World of Prajapan (Viraj), as also of one who is versed in 
the Vedas, sinless and free from desire. The bliss in the World 
of Prajapati, multiplied a hundred times, makes one measure of 
bliss in the World of Brahma (Hiranyagarbha), as also of one 
who is versed in the Vedas, sinless and free from desire. This, 
indeed, is the supreme bliss. This is the state of Brahman, O 
Emperor," said Yajnavalkya. 

Janaka said: I give you a thousand cows, venerable Sir. Please 
instruct me further about Liberation itself." 

At this Yajnavalkya was afraid that the intelligent emperor was 
driving him to give the solution of all his questions. 


34 


"That entity (the self), after enjoying himself and roaming in 
the dream state and merely witnessing the results of merits and 
demerits, hastens back in the reverse way to its former 
condition, the waking state. 


35 


"Just as a heavily loaded cart moves along, creaking, even so 
the self identified with the body, being presided over by the 
Self which is all consciousness (the Supreme Self), moves 
along, groaning, when breathing becomes difficult at the 
approach of death. 


36 


"When this body grows thin—becomes emaciated or disease— 
then, as a mango or a fig or a fruit of the peepul tree becomes 
detached from its stalk, so does this infinite being completdy 
detaching himself from the parts of the body, again move on, in 
the same way that he came, to another body for the 
remanisfestation of his vital breath (prana). 


37 
"Just as, when a king comes, the ugras appointed to deal with 
crimes; the sutas and the leaders of the village await him with 


food and drink and lodgings ready, saying: "Here he comes, 
here he comes,' even so, for the person who knows about the 


 


fruits of his own work, there wait all the elements, saying: 
'Here comes Brahman, here he comes.' 


38 


"Just as, when the king wishes to depart, the ugras appointed to 
deal with crimes, the sutas and the leaders of the village gather 
around him, even so do all the organs gather around the self, at 
the time of death, when it struggles for breath." 


Chapter 'V—Death and the Hereafter 
1 


Yajnavalkya continued: "Now, when that self becomes weak 
and unconscious, as it were, the organs gather around it. 
Having wholly seized these particles of light, the self comes to 
the heart. When the presiding deity of the eye turns back from 
all sides, the dying man fails to notice colour. 


2 


"The eye becomes united with the subtle body; then people say: 
'He does not see.' The nose becomes united with the subtle 
body; then they say: "He does not smell.' The tongue becomes 
united with the subtle body; then they say: "He does not taste.' 
The vocal organ becomes united with the subtle body; then they 
say: 'He does not speak.' The ear becomes united with the 
subtle body; then they say: "He does not hear.' The mind 
becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: 'He does 
not think.' The skin becomes united with the subtle body; then 
they say: 'He does not touch.' The intellect becomes united 
with the subtle body; then they say: "He does not know.' 

"The upper end of the heart lights up and by that light the self 
departs, either through the eye or through the head or through 
any other part (aperture) of the body. 

"And when the self departs, the vital breath follows and when 
the vital breath departs, all the organs follow. 

"Then the self becomes endowed with a particular 
consciousness and passes on to the body to be attained by that 
consciousness. 

"Knowledge, work and past experience follow the self. 


3 


"And just as a leech moving on a blade of grass reaches its end, 
takes hold of another and draws itself together towards it, so 
does the self, after throwing off this body, that is to say, after 
making it unconscious, take hold of another support and draw 
itself together towards it. 


 


4 


"And just as a goldsmith takes a small quantity of gold and 
fashions out of it another—a newer and better—form, so does 
the self, after throwing off this body, that is to say, after making 
it unconscious, fashion another—a newer and better—form, 
suited to the Manes, or the gandharvas, or the gods, or Viraj, or 
Hiranyagarbha, or other beings. 


5 


"That self is indeed Brahman; it is also identified with the 
intellect, the mind and the vital breath, with the eyes and ears, 
with earth, water, air and akasa, with fire and with what is other 
than fire, with desire and with absence of desire, with anger and 
with absence of anger, with righteousness and unrighteousness, 
with all—it is identified, as is well known, with this (i.e. what 
is perceived) and with that (i.e. what is inferred). According as 
it acts and according as it behaves, so it becomes: by doing 
good it becomes good and by doing evil it becomes evil. It 
becomes virtuous through virtuous action and evil through evil 
action. 

"Others, however, say that the self is identified with desire 
alone. As is its desire, so is its resolution; and as is its 
resolution, so is its deed; and whatever deed it does, that it 
reaps. 


6 


"Regarding this there is the following verse: 

"Because of attachment, the transmigrating self, together with 
its work, attains that result to which its subtle body or mind 
clings. Having exhausted in the other world the results of 
whatever work it did in this life, it returns from that world to 
this world for fresh work.' 

"Thus does the man who desires transmigrate. But as to the 
man who does not desire—who is without desire, who is freed 
from desire, whose desire is satisfied, whose only object of 
desire is the Self—his organs do not depart. Being Brahman, he 
merges in Brahman. 


2 


"Regarding this there are the following verses: 

"When all the desires that dwell in his heart are got rid of, then 
does the mortal man become immortal and attain Brahman in 
this very body.' 

"Just as the slough of a snake lies, dead and cast away, on an 
ant—hill, even so lies this body. Then the self becomes 
disembodied and immortal Spirit, the Supreme Self (Prana), 


 


Brahman, the Light." 
Janaka, Emperor of Videha, said: "I give you, venerable Sir, a 
thousand cows." 


8 


"Regarding this there are the following verses: 

'The subtle, ancient path stretching far away has been touched 
(reached) by me; nay, I have realized it myself. By this path the 
wise, the knowers of Brahman, move on to the celestial sphere 
(Liberation) after the fall of this body, having been freed even 
while living.' 


9 


'Some speak of it as white, others as blue, grey, green, or red. 
This path is realized by a knower of Brahman and is trod by 
whoever knows Brahman, has done good deeds and is 
identified with the Supreme Light.' 


10 


'Into blinding darkness enter those who worship ignorance; into 
a greater darkness than that, as it were, enter those who are 
devoted to knowledge.' 


11 


'Cheerless indeed are those worlds covered with blinding 
darkness. To them after death go those people who are ignorant 
and unwise.' 


12 


'If a man knows the Self as I am this, then desiring what and 
for whose sake will he suffer in the wake of the body?' 


13 


"Whoever has realized and intimately known the Self, Which 
has entered this perilous and perplexing place (the body), is the 
maker of the universe; for he is the maker of all. All is his Self 
and he, again, is indeed the Self of all.' 


14 
'Dwelling in this very body, we have somehow realized 
Brahman; otherwise we should have remained ignorant and 


great destruction would have overtaken us. Those who know 
Brahman become immortal, while others only suffer misery.' 


 


15 


"When a person following the instructions of a teacher directly 
beholds the effulgent Self, the Lord of all that has been and will 
be, he no longer wishes to hide himself from It.' 


16 


'That under which the year with its days rolls on—upon that 
immortal Light of lights the gods meditate as longevity.' 


17 


'That in which the five groups of five and the akasa rest, that 
very Atman I regard as the Immortal Brahman. Knowing that 
Brahman, I am immortal.' 


18 


'They who know the Vital Breath (Prana) of the vital breath 
(prana), the Eye of the eye, the Ear of the ear, the Mind of the 
mind, have realized the ancient, primordial Brahman.' 


19 


'Through the mind alone is Brahman to be realized. There is in 
It no diversity. He goes from death to death who sees in It, as it 
were, diversity.' 


20 


'Unknowable and constant, It should be realized in one form 
only. The Self is free from taint, beyond the akasa, birthless, 
infinite and unchanging.' 


21 


'The intelligent seeker of Brahman, learning about the Self 
alone, should practise wisdom (prajna). Let him not think of too 
many words, for that is exhausting to the organ of speech.' 


22 


"That great, unborn Self, which is identified with the intellect 
(vijnanamaya) and which dwells in the midst of the organs, lies 
in the akasa within the heart. It is the controller of all, the lord 
of all, the ruler of all. It does not become greater through good 
deeds or smaller through evil deeds. It is the lord of all, the 
ruler of all beings, the protector of all beings. It is the dam that 
serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart. The 


 


brahmins seek to realize It through the study of the Vedas, 
through sacrifices, through gifts and through austerity which 
does not lead to annihilation. Knowing It alone one becomes a 
sage (muni). Wishing for this World (i.e. the Self) alone, monks 
renounce their homes. 

"The knowers of Brahman of olden times, it is said, did not 
wish for offspring because they thought: 'What shall we do 
with offspring—we who have attained this Self, this World?' 
They gave up, it is said, their desire for sons, for wealth and for 
the worlds and led the life of religious mendicants. That which 
is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is 
the desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds; for both these, 
indeed, are but desires. 

"This Self is That which has been described as Not this, not 
this. It is imperceptible, for It is not perceived; undecaying, for 
It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered, 
for It never feels pain and never suffers injury. 

'Him who knows this these two thoughts do not overcome: For 
this I did an evil deed and For this I did a good deed. He 
overcomes both. Things done or not done do not afflict him.' 


23 


"This has been expressed by the following Rig verse: 

'This is the eternal glory of Brahman: It neither increases nor 
decreases through work. Therefore one should know the nature 
of That alone. Knowing It one is not touched by evil action.' 
"Therefore he who knows It as such becomes self—controlled, 
calm, withdrawn into himself, patient and collected; he sees the 
Self in his own self (body); he sees all as the Self. Evil does not 
overcome him, but he overcomes all evil. Evil does not afflict 
him, but he consumes all evil. He becomes sinless, taintless, 
free from doubts and a true Brahmana (knower of Brahman). 
This is the World of Brahman, O Emperor and you have 
attained It." Thus said Yajnavalkya. 

Janaka said: 'Venerable Sir, I give you the empire of Videha 
and myself, too, with it, to wait upon you. 


24 


That great, unborn Self is the eater of food and the giver of 
wealth. He who knows this obtains wealth. 


25 
That great, unborn Self is undecaying, immortal, undying, 


fearless; It is Brahman (infinite). Brahman is indeed fearless. 
He who knows It as such becomes the fearless Brahman. 


 


Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi (II) 
1 


Yajnavalkya had two wives: Maitreyi and Katyayani. Of these, 
Maitreyi was conversant with the Knowledge of Brahman, 
while Katyayani had an essentially feminine outlook. One day 
Yajnavalkya, when he wished to embrace another mode of life, 


2 


Said: "Maitreyi, my dear, I am going to renounce this life to 
become a monk. Let me make a final settlement between you 
and Katyayani." 


3 


Maitreyi said: "Venerable Sir, if indeed the whole earth full of 
wealth belonged to me, would I be immortal through that or 
not?" "No," replied Yajnavalkya, "your life would be just like 
that of people who have plenty. Of Immortality, however, there 
is no hope through wealth." 


4 


Then Maitreyi said: "What should I do with that which would 
not make me immortal? Tell me, venerable Sir, of that alone 
which you know to be the only means of attaining 
Immortality." 


5 


Yajnavalkya replied: "My dear, you have been my beloved 
even before and now you have resolved to know what is after 
my heart. If you wish, my dear, I shall explain it to you. As I 
explain it, meditate on what I say." 


6 


And he said: "Verily, not for the sake of the husband, my dear, 
is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self 
which, in its true nature, is one with the Supreme Self. 
"Verily, not for the sake of the wife, my dear, is the wife loved, 
but she is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of wealth, my dear, is wealth loved, 
but it is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the animals, my dear, are the 
animals loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 


 


"Verily, not for the sake of the brahmin, my dear, is the 
brahmin loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the kshatriya, my dear, is the 
kshatriya loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. 
"Verily, not for the sake of the worlds, my dear, are the worlds 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the gods, my dear, are the gods 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the Vedas, my dear, are the Vedas 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the beings, my dear, are the beings 
loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, not for the sake of the All, my dear, is the All loved, 
but it is loved for the sake of the self. 

"Verily, my dear Maitreyi, it is the Self that should be 
realized—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. 
By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, 
reflection and meditation, all this is known. 


7 


"The brahmin rejects one who knows him as different from the 
Self. The kshatriya rejects one who knows him as different 
from the Self. The worlds reject one who knows them as 
different from the Self. The gods reject one who knows them as 
different from the Self. The Vedas reject one who knows them 
as different from the Self. The beings reject one who knows 
them as different from the Self. The All rejects one who knows 
it as different from the Self. This brahmin, this kshatriya, these 
worlds, these gods, these Vedas, these beings and this All—are 
that Self. 


8—10 


"As the various particular kinds of notes of a drum, when it is 
beaten, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped only 
when the general note of the drum or the general sound 
produced by different kinds of strokes is grasped; 

"And as the various particular notes of a conch, when it is 
blown, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped only 
when the general note of the conch or the general sound 
produced by different kinds of blowing is grasped; 

"And as the various particular notes of a vina, when it is 
played, cannot be grasped by themselves, but are grasped only 
when the general note of the vina or the general sound 
produced by the different kinds of playing is grasped; 


 


11 


"As from a fire kindled with wet fuel various kinds of smoke 
issue forth, even so, my dear, the Rig—Veda, the Yajur—Veda, 
the Sama—Veda, the Atharvangirasa, history (itihasa), 
mythology (purana), the arts (vidya), Upanishads, verses 
(slokas), aphorisms (sutras), elucidations (anuvyakhyanas), 
explanations (vyakhyanas), sacrifices, oblations in the fire, 
food, drink, this world, the next world and all beings are all like 
the breath of this infinite Reality. From this Supreme Self are 
all these, indeed, breathed forth. 


12 


"As the ocean is the one goal of all waters (the place where 
they merge), so the skin is the one goal of all kinds of touch, 
the nostrils are the one goal of all smells, the tongue is the one 
goal of all savours, the ear is the one goal of all sounds, the 
mind is the one goal of all deliberations, the intellect is the one 
goal of all forms of knowledge, the hands are the one goal of all 
actions, the organ of generation is the one goal of all kinds of 
enjoyment, the excretory organ is the one goal of all excretions, 
the feet are the one goal of all kinds of walking, the organ of 
speech is the one goal of all the Vedas. 


13 


"As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside and is 
altogether a homogeneous mass of taste, even so this Self, my 
dear, has neither inside nor outside and is altogether a 
homogeneous mass of Intelligence. This Self comes out as a 
separate entity from the elements and with their destruction this 
separate existence is also destroyed. After attaining this 
oneness it has no more consciousness. This is what I say, my 
dear." 

So said Yajnavalkya. 


14 


Then Maitreyi said: "Just here you have completely bewildered 
me, venerable Sir. Indeed, I do not at all understand this." 

He replied: "Certainly I am not saying anything bewildering, 
my dear. Verily, this Self is immutable and indestructible. 


15 
"For when there is duality, as it were, then one sees another, 
one smells another, one tastes another, one speaks to another, 


one hears another, one thinks of another, one touches another, 
one knows another. But when to the knower of Brahman 


 


everything has become the Self, then what should he see and 
through what, what should he smell and through what, what 
should he taste and through what, what should he speak and 
through what, what should he hear and through what, what 
should he think and through what, what should he touch and 
through what, what should he know and through what? 
Through what should one know That Owing to which all this is 
known? 

"This Self is That which has been described as 'Not this, not 
this.' It is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, 
for It never decays; unattached, for It never attaches Itself; 
unfettered, for It never feels pain and never suffers injury. 
Through what, O Maitreyi, should one know the Knower? 
"Thus you have the instruction given to you. This much, 
indeed, is the means to Immortality." 

Having said this, Yajnavalkya renounced home.

Salutation to Brahman. 


Part Five 
Chapter I—The Infinity of Brahman 
I 


Om. Infinite is That Brahman, infinite in this manifested 
universe. From the Infinite Brahman proceeds the infinite. 
After the realization of the Great Identity or after the cosmic 
dissolution, when the infinity of the infinite universe merges in 
the Infinite Brahman, there remains the Infinite Brahman alone. 
Om is the Akasa Brahman—the primeval akasa. It is the akasa 
containing air, says the son of Kauravayarn. It (Om) is the 
Veda—thus the knowers of Brahman know; for through it one 
knows what is to he known. 


Chapter II—The Three Great Disciplines 
1 


Prajapati had three kinds of offspring: gods, men and demons 
(asuras). They lived with Prajapati, practising the vows of 
brahmacharins. After finishing their term, the gods said to him: 
"Please instruct us, Sir." To them he uttered the syllable da and 
asked: 

"Have you understood?" They replied: "We have. You said to 
us, 'Control yourselves (damyata).' He said: "Yes, you have 
understood." 


2 


Then the men said to him: "Please instruct us, Sir" To them he 
uttered the same syllable da and asked: 


 


"Have you understood?" They replied: "We have. You said to 
us, 'Give (datta).' He said: "Yes, you have understood. 


3 


Then the demons said to him: "Please instruct us, Sir." To them 
he uttered the same syllable da and asked: 

"Have you understood?" They replied: "We have. You said to 
us: "Be compassionate (dayadhvam).' He said: "Yes, you have 
understood." 

That very thing is repeated even today by the heavenly voice, in 
the form of thunder, as "Da," "Da," "Da," which means: 
"Control yourselves," "Give," and "Have compassion." 
Therefore one should learn these three: self—control, giving 
and mercy. 


Chapter I—Brahman as the Heart 
1 


Prajapati is this—the heart (intellect). It (the heart) is Brahman. 
It is all. Hridayam (the heart) consists of three syllables. One 
syllable is hri; and to him who knows this, his own people and 
others bring presents. One syllable is da; and to him who knows 
this, his own people and others give their powers. One syllable 
is yam; and he who knows this goes to heaven. 


Chapter V—Meditation on Satya Brahman 
1 


That intellect Brahman was verily this—satya alone. And 
whosoever knows this great, glorious first—born one as the 
Satya Brahman conquers these worlds. And his enemy is thus 
conquered and becomes non—existent—yes, whosoever knows 
this great, glorious first—born one as the Satya Brahman; for 
Satya indeed is that Brahman. 


Chapter V—In Praise of Satya Brahman 
1 


In the beginning this universe was water alone. That water 
produced Satya. Satya is Brahman. Brahman produced 
Prajapati and Prajapati the gods. Those gods meditate on Satya. 
This name Satya consists of three syllables. Sa is one syllable, 
ti is one syllable and ya is one syllable. The first and last 
syllables are the truth. In the middle is untruth. This untruth is 
enclosed on both sides by truth; thus truth preponderates. 
Untruth does not hurt him who knows this. 


 


2 


Now, that which is Satya is the sun—the being who dwells in 
yonder orb and the being who is in the right eye. These two rest 
on each other. The former (the being in the sun) rests on the 
latter (the being in the right eye) through his rays and the latter 
rests on the former through his organs. When the individual self 
is about to leave the body, he sees the solar orb clearly (i.e. 
without rays). Those rays no longer come to him. 


3 


Of this being who is in the solar orb, the syllable Bhuh is the 
head, for there is one head and there is this one syllable; the 
word Bhuvah is the arms, for there are two arms and there are 
these two syllables; the word Svah is the legs, for there are two 
legs and there are these two syllables. His secret name is Ahar. 
He who knows this destroys evil and leaves it behind. 


4 


Of this being who is in the right eye, the syllable Bhur is the 
head, for there is one head and there is this one syllable; the 
word Bhuvar is the arms, for there are two arms and there are 
these two syllables; the word Svar is the legs, for there are two 
legs and there are these two syllables. His secret name is Aham. 
He who knows this destroys evil and leaves it behind. 


Chapter VI—Meditation on Brahman as the Mind 
1 


This being identified with the mind and resplendent by nature is 
realized by yogis within the heart as of the size of a grain of 
rice or barley. He is the lord of all, the ruler of all and governs 
all this 

—whatever there is. 


Chapter VII—Meditation on Brahman as Lightning 

I 

They say that lightning is Brahman. It is called lightning 
(vidyut) because it scatters (vidanat) darkness. Whosoever 


knows this—that lightning is Brahman—scatters the evils that 
are ranged against him; for lightning is indeed Brahman. 


 


Chapter VIII—Meditation on the Vedas as a Cow

One should meditate upon speech (the Vedas) as a cow. She 
(speech) has four teats: the sounds Svaha; Vashat, Hanta and 
Svadha. The gods live on two of her teats, Svaha and Vashat; 
men, on Hanta; and the Manes on Svadha. Her bull is the vital 
breath (prana) and her calf, the mind. 


Chapter IX——Meditation on the Vaisvanara Fire 

1 

This fire which is within a man and digests food that is eaten is 
Vaisvanara. Its sound is that which one hears by stopping the 


ears. When a man is about to leave the body, he hears this 
sound no more. 





Chapter X The Path of the Departing Soul 


1 


When a man departs from this world, he reaches the air. The air 
opens there for him as wide as the hole of a chariot wheel. 
Through this opening he ascends and reaches the sun. The sun 
opens there for him as wide as the hole of a lambara. By this 
opening he ascends and reaches the moon. The moon opens 
there for him as wide as the hole of a drum. By this opening he 
ascends and reaches a World free from grief and cold. There he 
dwells for endless years. 


Chapter XI—The Supreme Austerities 
1 


The supreme austerity is indeed that a man suffers when he is 
ill. He who knows this wins the highest world. 

The supreme austerity is indeed that a man, after death, is 
carried to the forest. He who knows this wins the highest world. 
The supreme austerity is indeed that a man, after death, is laid 
on the fire. He who knows this wins the highest world. 


Chapter XIJ—Meditation on Food and the Vital Breath as 
Brahman 


1 


Some say that food is Brahman; but this is not so, for food 
decays without the vital breath (prana). Others say that the vital 


 


breath is Brahman; but this is not so, for the vital breath dries 
up without food. These two deities (food and the vital breath), 
when they become united, attain the highest state 
(Brahmanhood). Thus reflecting, Pratrida said to his father: 
"What good, indeed, can I do him who knows this and what 
evil can I do him either?" 

His father answered, stopping him with a gesture of his hand: 
"Oh, no, Pratrida; for who would attain the highest merely by 
being identified with these two?" 

Further, he (the father) said to him this: "It is vi; food is verily 
vi, for all these creatures rest (visanti) on food. It is ram; the 
vital breath is ram, for all these creatures delight (ramante) in 
the vital breath." All creatures rest on him, all creatures delight 
in him, who knows this. 


Chapter XIJI—Meditation on the Vital Breath 
1 


One should meditate on the vital breath as the Uktha. The vital 
breath is the Uktha, for it raises up (utthapayati) all this 
universe. From him who knows this there is raised a son who is 
a knower of the vital breath and he wins union with and abode 
in the same world as the Uktha. 


2 


One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Yajus. The 
vital breath is the Yajus, for all these beings are united 
(yujyante) with one another if the vital breath is present. All 
beings are united to give eminence to him who knows this and 
he wins union with and abode in the same world as the Yajus 
(vital breath). 


3 


One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Saman. The 
vital breath is the Saman, for all these beings meet (samyanchi) 
if the Saman (vital breath) is present. For the sake of him who 
knows this all beings are united and they succeed in giving him 
eminence; and he wins union with and abode in the same world 
as the Saman. 


4 


One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Kshatra. The 
vital breath is the Kshatra, for the vital breath protects (trayate) 
the body from wounds (khanitoh). He who knows this attains 
the Kshatra (vital breath) which needs no other protector and he 
wins union with and abode in the same world as the Kshatra. 


 


Chapter XIV—The Sacred Gayatri 
1 


The words Bhumi (earth), Antariksha (sky) and Dyaus (heaven) 
form eight syllables and the first foot of the Gayatri consists of 
eight syllables. So the three worlds constitute the first foot of 
the Gayatri. Whosoever knows this about the first foot of the 
Gayatri wins all that is in the three worlds. 


2 


Richah, Yajumshi and Samani form eight syllables and the 
second foot of the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. So these 
three Vedas constitute the second foot of the Gayatri. 
Whosoever thus knows the second foot of the Gayatri wins as 
much as that treasury of knowledge, the three Vedas, has to 
confer. 


3 


Prana, apana and vyana form eight syllables and the third foot 
of the Gayatri. consists of eight syllables. So these three forms 
of the vital breath constitute the third foot of the Gayatri. 
Whosoever knows this about the third foot of the Gayatri wins 
all the living beings that are in the universe. 

Now, its turiya, apparently visible (darsata) and supramundane 
(paroraja) foot is this—sun that glows yonder. That which is 
fourth is called turiya. He (the being in the solar orb) is 
apparently visible (darsata), because he is seen, as it were, by 
the yogis. He is supramundane (paroraja), because he shines 
alone on the whole universe as its overlord. He who thus knows 
the fourth foot of the Gayatri shines with splendour and glory. 


4 


That Gayatri rests on that fourth, apparently visible, 
supramundane foot. And that, again, rests on truth. The eye is 
truth, for the eye is indeed truth. Therefore, even today, if two 
persons come disputing, one saying: "I saw it," and another: "I 
heard of it," we should trust the one who says: "I saw it. 

That truth rests on strength. The vital breath (prana) is strength. 
Hence truth rests on the vital breath. Therefore they say that 
strength is more powerful than truth. 

Thus the Gayatri is based on the vital breath within the body. 
That Gayatri protected the gayas. The organs are the gayas; 
therefore the Gayatri protected (tatre) the organs. Because it 
protected the organs, it is called the Gayatri. The Savitri verse, 
which the teacher communicates to the pupil, is no other than 


 


this. It saves the organs of the pupil to whom it is imparted by 
the teacher. 


5 


Some impart to the pupil the Savitri which is in the Anushtubh 
metre, saying: "The goddess of speech is Anushtubh; so we 
shall impart it to him." 

But one should not do that. One should impart only that Savitri 
which is Gayatri. Verily, if one who knows this accepts too 
much as a gift, as it were, it is not enough for even one foot of 
the Gayatri. 


6 


If he (the knower of the Gayatri) accepts as a gift the three 
worlds full of wealth, he will be receiving the fruit of knowing 
only the first foot of the Gayatri. If he accepts as a gift as much 
as this treasury of knowledge, the Vedas, has to confer, he will 
be receiving the fruit of knowing only the second foot of the 
Gayatri. And if he accepts as a gift as much as is covered by all 
living creatures in the world, he will be receiving the fruit of 
knowing only the third foot of the Gayatri. While the fruit of 
knowing its fourth, apparently visible, supramundane foot— 
yonder sun that glows—is not to be counterbalanced by any gift 
received. 

Indeed, how could anyone receive so much as a gift? 


7 


The salutation to the Gayatri: 

"O Gayatri, thou art one—footed, two—footed, three—footed 
and four—footed. And thou art without any feet, for thou art 
unattainable. Salutation to thee, fourth foot, apparently visible 
and supramundane! May the enemy never attain his object!" 
Should the knower of the Gayatri bear hatred towards anyone, 
he should either use this mantra: "May his desired object never 
flourish!"—in which case that object of the person against 
whom he thus salutes the Gayatri never flourishes—or he may 
say: "May I attain that cherished object of his!" 


8 


On this subject Janaka, Emperor of Videha, said to Budila, the 
son of Asvatarasva: "Well, how is it that you, who called 
yourself a knower of the Gayatri, have come to he an elephant 
and are carrying me?" 

He replied: "Because, Your Majesty, I did not know its mouth." 
Janaka said: "Fire is its mouth. If people put a large quantity of 
fuel into the fire, it is all burnt up. Similarly, a man who knows 


 


this, even if he commits a great many sins, consumes them all 
and becomes pure, clean and free from decay and death." 


Chapter XV—The Prayer of a Dying Person 
1 


The door (real nature) of the truth (Satya Brahman) is covered 
by a golden disc. Open it, O Nourisher! Remove it so that I 
who have been worshipping the truth may behold it. 

O Nourisher! O lone Traveller of the sky! O Controller! O Sun! 
O Offspring of Prajapati! Gather your rays. Withdraw your 
light. I would see through your grace that form of yours which 
is the most benign. I am indeed He, that purusha who dwells in 
the sun. I am immortal. 

Now when my body falls may my breath return to the all— 
pervading Prana! May this body, reduced to ashes, return to the 
earth! 

Om. O Fire, who art the symbol Om, O god of deliberations, 
remember, remember all that I have done. 

O Fire, lead us by the good path towards the enjoyment of the 
fruit of our action. You know, O god, all our deeds. Destroy our 
sin of deceit. We offer by words repeated salutations to you. 


Part Six 
Chapter I—The Supremacy of the Prana 
1 


Om. He who knows what is the oldest and greatest becomes the 
oldest and greatest among his kinsmen. The vital breath (prana) 
is indeed the oldest and greatest. He who knows this becomes 
the oldest and greatest among his kinsmen and also among 
those of whom he wishes to be so. 


2 


He who knows what is the most excellent (vasishtha) becomes 
the most excellent among his kinsmen. The organ of speech is 
indeed the vasishtha. He who knows this becomes the most 
excellent among his kinsmen and also among those of whom he 
wishes to be so. 


3 
He who knows what has the attribute of steadiness (pratishtha) 


lives steadily in rough as well as smooth places and times. The 
eye indeed is endowed with steadiness, for with the help of the 


 


eye one remains steady in rough as well as smooth places and 
times. He who knows this lives steadily in rough as well as 
smooth places and times. 


4 


He who knows prosperity (sampad) attains whatever object he 
desires. The ear indeed is prosperity, for when the ear is intact 
all the Vedas are acquired. He who knows this attains whatever 
object he desires. 


5 


He who knows the abode (ayatana) becomes the abode of his 
kinsmen and also of other people. The mind indeed is the 
abode. He who knows this becomes the abode of his kinsmen 
as well as of other people. 


6 


He who knows what has the attribute of procreation (prajati) is 
enriched with children and animals. Semen verily has this 
attribute. He who knows this is enriched with children and 
animals. 


a 


These organs, disputing about who was superior among them, 
went to Prajapati and asked: "Which one among us is the most 
excellent (vasishtha)?" He said: "That one among you is the 
most excellent by whose departure this body is considered to 
suffer most." 


8 


The organ of speech departed. After being absent for a whole 
year it came back and said: "How have you been able to live 
without me?" The other organs said: "We lived just as dumb 
people live, without speaking through the tongue, but living 
through the vital breath, seeing through the eye, hearing 
through the ear, knowing through the mind and procreating 
through the organ of generation." Then the organ of speech 
entered the body. 


9 
The eye departed. After being absent for a whole year it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 


The other organs said: "We lived just as blind people live, 
without seeing through the eye, but living through the vital 


 


breath, speaking through the organ of speech, hearing through 
the ear, knowing through the mind and procreating through the 
organ of generation." Then the eye entered the body. 


10 


The ear went out. After being absent for a whole year it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 
The other organs said: "We lived just as deaf people live, 
without hearing through the ear, but living through the vital 
breath, speaking through the organ of speech, seeing through 
the eye, knowing through the mind and procreating through the 
organ of generation." Then the ear entered the body. 


11 


The mind went out. After being absent for a whole year it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 
The other organs said: "We lived just as idiots live, without 
knowing through the mind, but living through the vital breath, 
speaking through the organ of speech, seeing through the eye, 
hearing through the ear and procreating through the organ of 
generation." Then the mind entered the body. 


12 


Then the organ of generation went out. After being absent for a 
whole year it came back and said: "How have you been able to 
live without me?" The other organs said: "We lived just as 
impotent people live, without procreating children through the 
organ of generation, but living through the vital breath, 
speaking through the organ of speech, seeing through the eye, 
hearing through the ear and knowing through the mind." Then 
the organ of generation entered the body. 


13 


Then as the vital breath was about to depart, it uprooted the 
organs from their places just as a great, noble horse of the 
Sindhu country tears up the pegs to which his feet are tied. 
They said: "Venerable Sir, please do not go out. We shall not 
be able to live without you." 

"If I am such, then give me an offering." 

"So be it." 


14 
The organ of speech said: "That attribute of being most 


excellent which I possess is yours." 
The eye said: "That attribute of steadiness which I possess is 


 


yours." 

The ear said: "That attribute of prosperity which I possess is 
yours." 

The mind said: "That attribute of being an abode which I 
possess is yours. 

The organ of generation said: "That attribute of procreation 
which I possess is yours." 

Then the vital breath said: "If I am such, then what will be my 
food and what will be my dress?" 

They replied: "Whatever food there is—including that of dogs, 
worms, insects and moths—will be your food and water will be 
your dress." 

He who knows the food of the vital breath to be such never 
happens to eat anything or accept anything that is not food. 
Wise men who are versed in the Vedas therefore take a sip of 
water Just before and after eating; they think that thereby they 
remove the nakedness of the vital breath. 


Chapter II—The Process of Rebirth 
1 


Svetaketu, the grandson of Aruna, came to the assembly of the 
Panchalas. He approached Pravahana, the son of Jivala, who 
was being waited upon by his courtiers. As soon as the king 
saw him, he said: 

"Is it you, boy?" He replied: "Yes, Sir." 

Then the king asked: "Have you been taught by your father?" 
"Yes," he replied. 


2 


The king said: "Do you know how people, after departing from 
this life, proceed on different paths?" "No," he replied. 

"Do you know how they return to this world?" "No," he replied. 
"Do you know why the other world is never filled up even 
though so many people go there again and again?" "No," he 
replied. 

"Do you know after how many offerings of oblations the water 
(the liquid oblation) becomes endowed with a human voice, 
rises up and speaks?" "No," he replied. 

"Do you know the means of access to the path leading to the 
gods or to that leading to the Manes, that is to say, through 
what deeds men attain the path leading to the gods or that 
leading to the Manes? We have heard the following words of 
the Mantra: 'I have heard of the two paths for men, one leading 
to the Manes and the other to the gods. Going along them they 
(departed souls) are united with their destination. They (the 
paths) lie between the father (heaven) and the mother (earth).' 
Svetaketu said: "I do not know even one of these." 


 


3 


Then the king invited him to stay. But the boy, disregarding the 
invitation, hurried away. He went to his father and said: "Did 
you not tell me before that you had fully instructed me?" 
"What then, my intelligent child?" 

"That fellow of a kshatriya asked me five questions and I did 
not know one of them." 

"What were they?" 

"These," said Svetaketu and he recited them. 


4 


The father said: "My child, believe me, whatever I myself 
knew, I told you. But come, let us go there and live as religious 
students (brahmachirins)." "You may go, Sir," the son replied. 
Then Gautama went to where King Pravahana, the son of 
Jivala, was giving audience. The king offered him a seat, 
ordered water for him and made him the reverential offering. 
Then he said: "Revered Gautama, we will give you a boon." 


5 


Gautama said: "You have promised me this boon. Now please 
tell me what you spoke about to my boy." 


6 


The king said: "Ah, those are divine boons, Gautama. Please 
ask a human boon." 


7 


Gautama said: "You know well that I have gold, cows, horses, 
maidservants, retinue and apparel. Please do not be ungenerous 
towards me in regard to that gift which is plentiful, infinite and 
in—exhaustible." 

The king said: "Then, verily, O Gautama, you should ask it in 
the prescribed way." 

Gautama replied: "I approach you as a disciple." 

The ancients used to approach a teacher through mere 
declaration. So Gautama lived with the king by merely 
announcing that he was a student. 


8 
The king said: "Please do not be offended with us even as your 
paternal grandfather was not offended with ours. Before now 


this knowledge never rested with a brahmin. But I shall teach it 
to you, for who can refuse you when you speak like this? 


 


9 


"Yonder world is the sacrificial fire, the sun is its fuel, the rays 
its smoke, the day its flame, the four quarters its cinders and the 
intermediate quarters its sparks. In this fire the gods offer faith 
as libation. Out of that offering King Moon is born. 


10 


"Parjanya (the god of rain), O Gautama, is the fire, the year is 
its fuel, the clouds its smoke, lightning its flame, the 
thunderbolt its cinders, the rumbling its sparks. In this fire the 
gods offer King Moon as libation. Out of that offering rain is 
produced. 


11 


"This world, O Gautama, is the fire, the earth is its fuel, fire its 
smoke, the night its flame, the moon its cinders, the stars its 
sparks. In this fire the gods offer rain as libation. Out of that 
offering food is produced. 


12 


"Man, O Gautama, is the fire, the open mouth is its fuel, the 
vital breath its smoke, speech its flame, the eye its cinders and 
the ear its sparks. In this fire the gods offer food as libation. 
Out of that offering semen is produced. 


13 


"Woman, O Gautama, is the fire, her sexual organ is the fuel, 
the hairs the smoke, the vulva the flame, sexual intercourse the 
cinders, enjoyment the sparks. In this fire the gods offer semen 
as libation. Out of this offering a man is born. He lives as long 
as he is to live. Then, when he dies, 


14 


"They carry him to be offered in the fire. The fire becomes his 
fire, the fuel his fuel, the smoke his smoke, the flame his flame, 
the cinders his cinders and the sparks his sparks. In this fire the 
gods offer the man as libation. Out of this offering the man 
emerges in radiant splendour. 


15 
"Those even among householders who know this, as described 


and those too who, living in the forest, meditate with faith upon 
the Satya Brahman (Hiranyagarbha), reach the deity identified 


 


with flame, from him the deity of the day, from him the deity 
of) the fortnight in which the moon waxes, from him the deities 
of the six months during which the sun travels northward, from 
them the deity identified with the world of the gods (devaloka), 
from him the sun, from the sun the deity of lightning. Then a 
being created from the mind of Hiranyagarbha comes and leads 
them to the worlds of Brahmin. In those worlds of Brahma they 
become exalted and live for many years. They no more return 
to this world. 


16 


"But those who conquer the worlds through sacrifices, charity 
and austerity reach the deity of smoke, from smoke, the deity of 
the night, from night the deity of the fortnight in which the 
moon wanes, from the decreasing half of the moon the deities 
of the six months during which the sun travels southward, from 
these months the deity of the world of the Manes and from the 
world of the Manes, the moon. Reaching the moon they 
become food. There the gods enjoy them, just as here the 
priests drink the shining soma juice—saying as it were: 
"Flourish, dwindle." And when their past work is exhausted 
they reach this very akasa, from the akasa they reach the air, 
from the air rain, from rain the earth. Reaching the earth they 
become food. Then they are again offered in the fire of man 
and thence in the fire of woman. Out of the fire of woman they 
are born and perform rites with a view to going to other worlds. 
Thus do they rotate. 

"Those, however, who do not know these two ways become 
insects and moths and those creatures which often bite (i.e. 
mosquitoes and gnats)." 


Chapter II1I—Rites for the Attainment of Wealth 
i 


Whoever wishes to attain greatness (i.e. wealth for performing 
sacrificial rites) should act as follows: On an auspicious day of 
the fortnight in which the moon waxes, under a constellation 
bearing a masculine name, during the northward journey of the 
sun, he should undertake for twelve days a vow connected with 
the Upasads, gather in a cup or a bowl made of fig wood all the 
herbs and their grains, sweep and plaster the ground, lay the 
fire, spread the kusa grass, purify the offering (clarified butter) 
according to the rules, place between himself and the fire the 
mantha (the paste made of those herbs etc.) and offer oblations 
with the following mantras: 

"O Fire, to all those gods under you who spitefully slay men's 
desires, I offer their share. May they be satisfied and satisfy me 
with all the objects of my desire! Svaha! 


 


"To that deity who turns out to be spiteful under your 
protection, thinking that she is the support of all, I offer this 
stream of clarified butter. Svaha!" 


2 


"Svaha to the oldest, svaha to the greatest!"—uttering these 
words, he offers an oblation in the fire and lets the remainder 
adhering to the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 

"Svaha to the vital breath (prana), svaha to the vasishtha (the 
most excellent)!"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation 
in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into 
the paste (mantha). 

"Svaha to the organ of speech, svaha to that which has 
steadiness!" 

—uttering these words, he offers an oblation in the fire and lets 
the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 
"Svaha to the eye, svaha to prosperity!"—uttering these words, 
he offers an oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering 
to the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 

"Svaha to the ear, svaha to the abode!"—uttering these words, 
he offers an oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering 
to the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 

"Svaha to the mind, svaha to procreation (prajati)!"—uttering 
these words, he offers an oblation in the fire and lets the 
remainder adhering to the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 
"Svaha to the organ of generation!"—uttering these words, he 
offers an oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to 
the ladle drip into the paste (mantha). 


3 


"Svaha to fire"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation in 
the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into the 
paste. 

"Svaha to the moon"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to the earth"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to the sky"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation 
in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into 
the paste. 

"Svaha to heaven"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation 
in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into 
the paste. 

"Svaha to earth, sky and heaven"—uttering these words, he 
offers an oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to 
the ladle drip into the paste. 


 


"Svaha to the brahmin"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to the kshatriya"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to the past"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation 
in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into 
the paste. 

"Svaha to the future"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to the universe"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 

"Svaha to all"—uttering these words, he offers an oblation in 
the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle drip into the 
paste. 

"Svaha to Prajapati"—uttering these words, he offers an 
oblation in the fire and lets the remainder adhering to the ladle 
drip into the paste. 


4 


Then he touches the paste, uttering the mantra: "You move as 
the vital breath; you bum as fire; you are infinite as Brahman; 
you are unshaken as the sky. You are the meeting—place of all. 
You are the sound hing and are uttered as hing in the sacrifice 
by the prastotri. You are the Udgitha and are chanted by the 
udgatri. You are recited by the adhvaryu and recited back by 
the agnidhra. You are fully ablaze in the moist cloud. You are 
omnipresent and the ruler. You are food as the moon and light 
as fire. You are death and you are that in which all things 
merge." 


5 


Then he raises the paste, saying: "As the vital breath you know 
all; we too are aware of your greatness as the vital breath. The 
vital breath is the king, the ruler, the sovereign. May it make 
me king, ruler and sovereign." 


6 


Then he eats the paste, saying: "Tat saviturvarenyam' ('That 
adorable light')—' The winds blow sweetly (madhu), the rivers 
pour forth sweetness (madhu); may the herbs be sweet (madhu) 
unto us!' "'Svaha to the earth (Bhuh). 

'Bhargo devasya dhimahi'—('Of the radiant sun, We meditate 
upon' )—' May the nights and days be sweet (madhu), may the 


 


dust of the earth be sweet (madhu), may heaven, our father, be 
sweet (madhu)!' 'Svaha to the sky (Bhuvah).' 

'Dhiyo yo nah prachodayit' ('May He stimulate our 

intellect' )— 

'May the soma creeper be sweet (madhu) unto us, may the sun 
be sweet (madhu), may the quarters be filled with sweetness 
(madhu) for us!' 'Svaha to heaven (Svah).' 

Then he repeats the whole Gayatri and all the verses about 
sweetness (madhumati) and says at the end: "May I be all this! 
Svaha to earth, sky and heaven. 

Then he eats all that is left of the paste, washes his hands and 
lies down behind the fire with his head to the east. 

In the morning he salutes the sun saying: "You are the one 
non—dual and best lotus of the quarters; may I be the one lotus 
among men. 

Then he returns the way he went, sits behind the fire and 
repeats the line of teachers. 


7 


Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, taught this to his pupil Vijasaneya 
Yajnavalkya and said: "Should One pour it (the paste) even On 
a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves spring forth." 


8 


Then Vajasaneya Yajnavalkya taught this to his pupil 
Madhuka, the son of Paingi and said: "Should one pour it even 
on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves spring forth."

Then Madhuka, the son of Paingi, taught this to his pupil 
Chula, the son of Bhagavitta and said: "Should one pour it even 
on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves spring forth." 


10 


Then Chula, the son of Bhagavitta, taught this to his disciple 
Janaki, the son of Ayasthuna and said: "Should One pour it 
even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves spring 
forth." 


11 
Then Janaki, the son of Ayasthuna, taught this to his pupil 
Satyakama, the son of Jabala and said: "Should one pour it 


even on a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves spring 
forth." 


 


12 


And Satyakama, the son of Jabala, taught this to his pupils and 
said: 

"Should one pour it even on a dry stump, branches would grow 
and leaves spring forth." 

One must not teach this to anyone but a son or a pupil. 


13 


Four articles are made of fig wood: the sacrificial ladle, the 
bowl, the fuel and the two mixing—rods. 

The cultivated grains are ten in number: Rice, barley, sesamum, 
beans, millet (anu), panic seeds (priyangu), wheat, lentils, pulse 
and vetch. 

They should be crushed and soaked in curds, honey and 
clarified butter and offered as an oblation. 


Chapter V—Conception and Birth as Religious Rites 
1 


The earth is verily the essence of all these beings, water is the 
essence of the earth, herbs of water, flowers of herbs, fruits of 
flowers, man of fruits and semen is the essence of man. 


2 


Prajapati said to Himself: "Well, let Me make a firm basis for it 
(semen)." So He created woman. Having created her, He placed 
her below and worshipped her. Therefore one should worship a 
woman, placing her below. He (Prajapati) extended His organ 
that projects and with it impregnated her. 


3 


Her lap is the sacrificial altar, her hair the sacrificial grass, her 
skin within the organ the lighted fire; the two labia of the vulva 
are the two stones of the soma—press. 

He who, knowing this, practises sexual intercourse wins as 
great a world as is won through the Vijapeya sacrifice; he 
acquires for himself the fruit of the good deeds of the woman. 
But he who, without knowing this, practises sexual intercourse 
turns over to the woman his own good deeds. 


4 
Having known this, Uddalaka the son of Aruna, Naka the son 


of Mudgala and Kumara—harita said: "Many mortals, 
brahmins only in name, perform the sexual act without 


 


knowledge of what has been said and depart from this world 
impotent and without merit." 

Even if this much semen—of one asleep or of one awake—is 
spilled, 


S 


He should touch it and repeat the following mantra: 

"Whatever semen of mine has spilt on earth, whatever has 
flowed to plants, whatever to water, I reclaim it." 

With these words he should take the semen with his ring finger 
and thumb and rub it between his breasts or eyebrows, 
repeating the following mantra: 

"Let the semen return to me, let Vigour come to me again, let 
glow and good fortune come to me again. May the deities who 
dwell in the sacrificial fire put the semen back in its proper 
place." 


6 


Now, if a man sees himself (his reflection) in water, he should 
recite the following mantra: 

"May the gods bestow on me vigour, manhood, fame, wealth 
and merit." 

In praise of the wife who will bear him a son: 

She (his wife) has put on the soiled clothes of impurity; she is, 
verily, loveliness among women. Therefore when she has 
removed the clothes of impurity and appears beautiful, he 
should approach her and speak to her. 


7 


If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy 
her with presents. If she is still unyielding, he should strike her 
with a stick or with his hand and overcome her, repeating the 
following mantra: 

"With power and glory I take away your glory." 

Thus she becomes discredited. 


8 

If she grants his desire, he should repeat the following mantra: 
"With power and glory I give you glory." 

Thus they both become glorious. 

9 

If a man desires his wife with the thought: "May she enjoy love 


with me," then, after inserting the member in her, joining 
mouth to mouth and stroking her organ, he should utter the 


 


following mantra: 

"O semen, you have been produced from my every limb, 
especially from my heart through the essence of food you are 
the essence of the limbs. Bring this woman under my control, 
like a deer pierced by a poisoned arrow." 


10 


Now, the wife whom he desires with the thought: "May she not 
conceive"—after inserting the member in her and joining 
mouth to mouth, he should inhale and then exhale, repeating 
the following mantra: 

"With power, with semen, I reclaim the semen from you." 
Thus she comes to be without semen. 


11 


Now, the wife whom he desires with the thought: "May she 
conceive"—after inserting the member in her and joining 
mouth to mouth, he should inhale and then exhale, repeating 
the following mantra: 

"With power, with semen, I deposit semen in you." 

Thus she verily becomes pregnant. 


12 


Now, if a man's wife has a paramour whom he detests, he 
should perform the following rite in order to cast an evil spell 
upon him: 

Let him put fire in an unbaked earthen vessel, spread stalks of 
reed and kusa grass inversely and offer in the sacrificial fire the 
reed tips, soaked in clarified butter, inversely, repeating the 
following mantra: 

"You have made a libation in my kindled fire! I take away your 
prana and apana, you, ! Here the name of the evil— 
doer should be uttered. You have made a libation in my kindled 
fire! I take away your sons and cattle, you, ! You have 
made a libation in my kindled fire! I take away your Vedic rites 
and those done according to the Smritis, you, ! You 
have made a libation in my kindled fire! I take away your hopes 
and expectations, you, 

He whom a brahmin who knows this rite curses, departs from 
this world impotent and shorn of merit. Therefore let no one 
even joke with the wife of a Vedic scholar who knows this rite; 
for he who has this knowledge is a dangerous enemy. 


13 
If a man's wife has the monthly sickness, she should for three 


days drink water from a cup made of bell metal. Let no sudra 


 


man or woman touch her. After three nights she should bathe, 
put on a new cloth and her husband should make her thresh 
rice. 


14 


If a man wishes that a son with a fair complexion should be 
born to him, that he should study one Veda and that he should 
attain a full term of life, then they (husband and wife) should 
have rice cooked in milk and eat it with clarified butter. Thus 
they should be able to beget such a son. 


15 


If a man wishes that a son with a tawny or brown complexion 
should be born to him, that he should study two Vedas and that 
he should attain a full term of life, then they should have rice 
cooked in curds and eat it with clarified butter. Thus they 
should be able to beget such a son. 


16 


If a man wishes that a son with a dark complexion and red eyes 
should be born to him, that he should study three Vedas and 
that he should attain a full term of life, then they should have 
rice cooked in water and eat it with clarified butter. Thus they 
should be able to beget such a son. 


17 


If a man wishes that a daughter should be born to him who will 
be a scholar and attain a full term of life, then they should have 
rice cooked with sesamum and eat it with clarified butter. Thus 
they should be able to beget such a daughter. 


18 


If a man wishes that a son should be born to him who will be a 
famous scholar, frequenting assemblies and speaking delightful 
words, a student of all the Vedas and an enjoyer of the full term 
of life, he should have rice cooked with the meat of a young 
bull or of one more advanced in years and he and his wife 
should eat it with clarified butter. Then they should be able to 
beget such a son. 


19 
Now, towards morning he purifies the clarified butter according 


to the rules of Sthalipaka and offers Sthalipaka oblations 
repeatedly, saying: 


 


"Svaha to fire! Svaha to Anumati! Svaha to the radiant sun, 
who produces infallible results!" 

Having made the offering, he takes up the remnant of the 
cooked food, eats part of it and gives the rest to his wife. Then 
he washes his hands, fills the water—vessel and sprinkles her 
thrice with water, uttering once this mantra: 

"Get up from here, O Visvavasu! Seek another young woman, a 
wife with her husband." 


20 


Then he embraces her, repeating the following mantra: 

I am the vital breath and you are speech. You are speech and I 
am the vital breath. I am Saman and you are Rig; I am heaven 
and you are earth. Come, let us strive together so that we may 
have a male child." 


21 


Then he spreads apart her thighs, repeating the following 
mantra: 

"Spread yourselves apart, Heaven and Earth." 

Inserting the member in her and joining mouth to mouth, he 
strokes her three times from head to foot, repeating the 
following mantra: 

"Let Vishnu make the womb capable of bearing a son! Let 
Tvashtra shape the various limbs of the child! Let Prajapati 
pour in the semen! Let Dhatra support the embryo! O Sinivali, 
make her conceive; O goddess whose glory is widespread, 
make her conceive! May the two Atvins, garlanded with 
lotuses, support the embryo! 


22 


"Let the two Atvins chum the womb with the two golden arani 
sticks! I am placing a seed in your womb to be delivered in the 
tenth month. As the earth has fire in its womb, as heaven is 
pregnant with the sun, as the quarters are impregnated by air, so 
I am impregnating you by placing this seed in your womb." 
After the reciting of the mantra, he utters his own name and 
that of his wife and places the seed. 


23 


When she is about to deliver the child, he sprinkles her with 
water, repeating the following mantra: 

"As the wind agitates a pond on every side, even so let your 
foetus stir and come out along with the chorion. Indra (prana) 
made a path when the seed entered the womb. O Indra, follow 


 


that path and come out with the foetus and the covering and 
cause also the after birth to come forth with the babe." 


24 


When the son is born, he should light a fire, take the child on 
his lap, put a mixture of curds and clarified butter in a bell— 
metal cup and offer oblations in the fire repeatedly, uttering the 
mantra: 

"May I increase as the son in my own home and support a 
thousand people! May the Goddess of Fortune never depart, 
with children and cattle, from his line! Svaha! The vital breath 
that is in me, I mentally offer to you. Svaha! If I have done 
anything too much or too little in this ceremony, may the all— 
knowing and highly beneficent fire make it just right and 
proper for me. Svaha!" 


25 


The, putting his month to the child's right ear, he should say 
thrice: "Speech! Speech!" Next he would mix together curds, 
honey and clarified butter and feed the child with a golden stick 
which is not placed inside the month, saying these mantras: 

"T put the earth (Bhuh) into you; I put the sky (Bhuvah) into 
you; I put heaven (Svah) into you. The whole of earth, sky and 
heaven I put into you." 


26 


Then he (the father) gives him (the son) a name: 'You are the 
Veda (knowledge)." That is his secret name. 


27 


Then he presents him to the mother to give him her breast, 
uttering the mantra: 

"O Sarasvati, that breast of thine which is fruitful, the sustainer 
of all, full of milk, the bestower of wealth and generous and by 
which thou nourishest all who are worthy—transfer that breast 
here to my wife, for my child to suck. 


28 


Then he addresses the mother of the child thus: 

"You are the adorable Arundhati, the wife of Vasishtha and 
with me, who am a man, as your partner you have brought forth 
a male child. Be the mother of many male children, for you 
have given us a son.

End of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 

The Peace Chant 

Om. That is full; this is full. This fullness has been projected 
from that fullness. When this fullness merges in that fullness, 


all that remains is fullness. 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Taittiriya Upanishad 
Part One 


On Siksha or Pronunciation 
Chapter I—Invocation 


Harih Om. 

May Mitra be propitious unto us! May Varuna be propitious 
unto us! May Aryaman be propitious unto us! May Indra and 
Brihaspati be propitious unto us! May Vishnu, of wide strides, 
be propitious unto us! 

Salutation to Brahman! Salutation to Thee, O Vayu! Thou 
indeed art the visible Brahman. Thee indeed I shall proclaim as 
the visible Brahman. Thee indeed, O Vayu, I shall proclaim as 
the right. Thee indeed I shall proclaim as the true. 

May It protect me! May It protect the teacher! May It protect 
me! May It protect the teacher! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Chapter II—Lesson on Pronunciation 


Om. We will expound siksha, or the science of pronunciation. 
It deals with sound, pitch, quantity, force, modulation and 
combination. Thus is explained the lesson on pronunciation. 


Chapter I1I—Meditation on the Combinations 
1 


May glory come on both of us together! May the light of 
Brahman shine alike through both of us! Now we will explain 
the Upanishad on the Samhita (combinations) under five heads: 
with regards to the worlds, the heavenly lights, knowledge, 
progeny and the atman (body). People call these the great 
Samhitas. First, with regard to the worlds: The earth is the first 
form, heaven is the last from, the akasa is the union and the air 
is the medium. Thus with regard to the worlds. 


2 
Next, with regard to the heavenly lights: Fire is the first form, 


the sun is the second form, water is the union and lightning is 
the medium. Thus with regard to the heavenly lights. 


 


3 


Next, with regard to knowledge: The teacher is the first form, 
the pupil is the second form, knowledge is the union and the 
recitation is the medium. Thus with regard to knowledge. 


4 


Next, with regard to progeny: The mother is the first form, the 
father is the second form, the progeny is the union and 
procreation is the medium. Thus with regard to the progeny. 


5 


Next, with regard to atman: The lower jaw is the first form, the 
upper jaw is the second form, the speech is the union and the 
tongue is the medium. Thus with regard to the atman. 


6 


There are the great Samhitas. He who meditates on these 
Samhitas, as here explained, becomes united with progeny, 
cattle, the light of Brahman, food and the heavenly world. 


Chapter Prayer for Wisdom and Fortune 
1 


May He who is the bull of the Vedic hymns, who assumes all 
forms, who has sprung from the immortal hymns of the 
Vedas—may that that Indra cheer me with wisdom. O God, 
may I be the possessor of immortality! 

May my body be competent; may my tongue be exceedingly 
sweet; may I hear abundantly with my ears. Thou art the sheath 
of Brahman, concealed by intelligence. Guard for me what I 
have learnt. 


2 


Om. Next bring me, without delay, fortune accompanied by 
wool and cattle—fortune which always provides me with 
clothes and cattle, food and drink. Increase them when they 
have been acquired and preserve them long when increased. 
Svaha! 

May brahmacharins come to me variously! Svaha! 

May brahmacharins come to me!. Svaha! 

May brahmacharins practise self—control! Svaha! 

May brahmacharins enjoy peace! Svaha! 


 


3 


May I become famous among men! Svaha! 

May I become richer than the rich! Svaha! 

O gracious Lord, may I enter into Thee! Svaha! 

May Thou, O gracious Lord, enter into me! Svaha! 

O Lord, I am cleansing my sins in that Self of Thine, which is 
like a river of a thousand branches. Svaha! 

O Preserver, as waters flow downward, as the months erge in 
the year, so may brahmacharins come to me from all directions! 
Svaha! 

Thou art a refuge. To me do Thou shine forth. Accept me unto 
Thyself completely. 


Chapter V—Four Mystical Utterances 


Bhuh, Bhuvah, Suvah—these are, verily, the three utterances. 
Besides these there is a forth, called Mahwah, which became 
known to the son of Mahachamasa. That is Brahman, that is the 
Self. The other gods are its limbs. 

Bhuh is, verily, this world; Bhuvah, the mid—region; Suvah, 
the world yonder; Mahah, the sun. Through the sun, indeed, do 
all the worlds become great. 

Bhuh is, verily, fire; Bhuvah, the air; Suvah, the sun; Mahah, 
the moon. By the moon, indeed, do all the heavenly lights 
become great. 

Bhuh is, verily, the Rik—verses; Bhuvah, the Saman; Suvah, 
the Yajus; Mahah, Brahman. By Brahman, indeed, do all the 
Vedas become great. 

Bhuh is, verily, the prana, Bhuvah, the apana; Suvah, the 
vyana; Mahah, food. By food, indeed, do all the breaths 
become great. 

They, these four, become fourfold. Four and four are the 
vyahritis. He who knows these knows Brahman. All the gods 
bring offerings to him. 


Chapter VI—Meditation on Saguna Brahman 
1 


There is a space within the heart; in it lies the Person consisting 
of mind, immortal and luminous. 

The Sushumna passes through the piece of flesh which hangs 
down like a nipple between the two palates and ends where the 
skull splits and the roots of hair lie apart. That Sushumna is the 
path for the realisation of Indra. The souls of the aspirants, 
passing through the Sushumna, rests in fire, represented by the 
vyahriti Bhuh; the rests in the air, represented by the vyahriti 
Bhuvah. 


 


2 


He rests in the sun, represented by the vyahriti Suvah; he rests 
in Brahman, represented by the vyahriti Mahah. 

He attains self—tule. He attains the lordship of the mind; he 
attains the lordship of speech; he attains the lordship of sight; 
he attains the lordship of hearing; he attains the lordship of 
intelligence. Furthermore, he becomes this—he becomes 
Brahman, whose body is space, whose nature is true, who 
delights in life and rejoices in the mid, who abounds in peace, 
who is immortal. 

Thus do thou, O Prachinayogya, contemplate. 


Chapter VII—Meditation on the Fivefold Nature and 
Individual 


Earth, the mid—region, heaven, the quarters and the 
intermediate quarters. Agni (fire), Vayu (air), Aditya (sun), 
Chandrama (moon) and the Nakshatras (stars). Water, herbs, 
tree, space and the body. So much with reference to material 
objects. 

Now with reference to the body: The prana, vyana, apana, 
udana and samana; the eye, the ear, the mind speech and touch; 
the skin, flesh, muscle, bone and marrow. 

Having thus ordained, a rishi said: "Whatever exists is 
fivefold." Through the fivefold one becomes united with the 
fivefold material object. 


Chapter VIII—Meditation on Om 


On is Brahman. Om is all this. This syllable Om is used to 
indicate compliance. When they are told: "Om, recite," they 
recite. Uttering Om, they sing the Saman chants. With "Om, 
Som," they recite the prayers. Uttering Om, the adhvaryu priest 
gives the response. Uttering Om, the Brahma gives assent. 
Uttering Om, gives permission to offer oblations in the 
Agnihotra sacrifice. When a Vedic teacher wishes to obtain 
Brahman he utters Om; thus desiring Brahman, he verily 
obtains Brahman. 


Chapter IX—Disciplines 


The disciplines are rightness and also the learning and teaching; 
truth and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; austerity 
and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; self—control 
and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; tranquillity and 
also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; the kindling of 
sacrificial fires and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; 
the performance of the Agnihotra sacrifice and also the learning 
and teaching of the Vedas; hospitality to guests and also the 


 


learning and teaching of the Vedas; the perfromance of social 
duties and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; 
procreation and also the learning and teaching of the Vedas; 
propagation of the race and also the learning and teaching of 
the Vedas. 

Differing views on the subject: Truth alone, according to 
Satyvachas of the line of Rathitara, should be practised; 
austerity alone, according to Taponitya the son of Purusishti; 
according to Naka the son of Mudgalya, the learning and 
teaching of the Vedas alone, for that is austerity. 


Chapter X—A Mantra for Daily Meditation 


I am the mover of the tree of the universe. My fame rises high, 
like a mountain peak. My root is the Supremely Pure Brahman. 
I am the unstained essence of the Self, like the nectar of 
immortality that resides in the sun. I am the brightest treasure. I 
am the shinning wisdom. I am immortal and undecaying. 

Thus did Trisanku proclaim after the attainment of the 
Knowledge of the Self of the Self. 


Chapter XI—Exhortation to the Departing Student 
1 


Having taught the Vedas, the teacher thus instructs the pupil: 
Speak the truth. Practise dharma. Do not neglect the study of 
the Vedas. Having brought to the teacher the gift desired by 
him, enter the householder's life and see that the line of 
progeny is not cut off. Do not swerve from the truth. Do not 
swerve from dharma. Do not neglect personal welfare. Do not 
neglect prosperity. Do not neglect the study and teaching of the 
Vedas. 


2 


Do not neglect your duties to the gods and the Manes. Treat 
your mother as God. Treat your father as God. Treat your 
teacher as God. Treat your guest as God. Whatever deeds are 
faultless, these are to be performed—not others. Whatever good 
works have been performed by us, those should be performed 
by you—not others. 


3 


Those brahmins who are superior to us—you should comfort 
them by giving them seats. 

Whatever is to be given should be given with faith, not without 
faith—according to one's plenty, with modesty, with fear, with 
sympathy. 


 


4 


Now, if there arises in your mind any doubt concerning any act, 
or any doubt concerning conduct, you should conduct yourself 
in such matters as brahmins would conduct themselves— 
brahmins who are competent to judge, who of their own accord 
are devoted to good deed and are not urged to their 
performance by others and who are not too severe, but are 
lovers of dharma. 

Now, with regards to persons spoken against, you should 
conduct yourself in such a way as brahmins would conduct 
themselves—brahmins who are competent to judge, who of 
their own accord are devoted to good deeds and are not urged 
to their performance by others and who are not too severe, but 
are lovers of dharma. 

This is the rule. This is the teaching. This is the secret wisdom 
of the Vedas. This is the command of God. 

This you should observe. This alone should be observed. 


Chapter XII—The Peace Chant 


May Mitra be propitious unto us! May Varuna be propitious 
unto us! May Aryaman be propitious unto us! May Indra and 
Brihaspati be propitious unto us! May Vishnu, of wide strides, 
be propitious unto us! 

Salutation to Brahman! Salutation to Thee, O Vayu! Thou 
indeed art the visible Brahman. Thee indeed I proclaimed as the 
visible Brahman. I proclaimed the right. I proclaimed the true. 
That protected me. That protected the teacher. Ay, that 
protected me, that protected the teacher. 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Part Two 


On Brahmananda or the Bliss of Brahman 
Chapter I—The Sheath of Food 
1 


Om. May Mitra be propitious unto us! May Varuna be 
propitious unto us! May Aryaman be propitious unto us! May 
Indra and Brihaspati be propitious unto us! May Vishnu, of 
wide strides, be propitious unto us! 

Salutation to Brahman! Salutation to Thee, O Vayu! Thou 
indeed art the visible Brahman. Thee indeed, O Vayu, I shall 
proclaim as the right! Thee indeed, I shall proclaim as the true! 
May It protect me! May It protect the teacher! May It protect 
me! May It protect the teacher! 


 


2 


Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 
us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 
Truth! May we cherish no ill—feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


3 


Om. He who knows Brahman attains the Supreme. 

On the above, the following mantra is recorded: 

"He who knows Brahman which is Reality, Knowledge and 
Infinity, hidden in the cave of the heart and in the highest 
akasa—he, being one with the omniscient Brahman, enjoys 
simultaneously all desires." 

From the Atman was born akasa; from akasa, air; from air, fire; 
from fire, water; from water, earth; from earth, herbs; from 
herbs, food; from food, man. 

He, that man, verily consists of the essence of food. This indeed 
is his head, this right arm is the right wing, this left arm is the 
left wing, this trunk is his body, this support below the navel is 
his tail. 


Chapter 1I—The Sheath of the Vital Breath 


"From food, verily, are produced all creatures—whatsoever 
dwell on earth. By food alone, furthermore, do they live and to 
food, in the end, do they return; for food alone is the eldest of 
all beings and therefore, it is called the panacea for all." 

"They who worship food as Brahman obtain all food. Food 
alone is the eldest of all beings and therefore it is called the 
panacea for all. From food all creatures are born: by food, when 
born, they grow. Because it is eaten by beings and because it 
eats beings, therefore it is called food." 

Verily, different from this, which consists of the essence of 
food, but within it, is another self, which consists of the vital 
breath. By this the former is filled. This too has the shape of a 
man. Like the human shape of the former is the human shape of 
the latter. Prana, indeed, is its head; vyana is its right wing; 
apana is its left wing; akasa is its trunk; the earth is its tail, its 
support. 


Chapter I1I—The Sheath of the Mind 
1 
"The gods breathe after the prana, so also do men and cattle; 


for the prana is the life of creatures. Therefore it is called the 
life of all. Those who worship the prana as Brahman obtain a 


 


full life; for the prana is the life of creatures. Therefore it is 
called the life of all." 


2 


This sheath of the Prana is the embodied soul of the former. 
Verily, different from this sheath, which consists of the essence 
of the prana, but within it, is another self, which consists of the 
mind. By this the former is filled. This too has the shape of a 
man. Like the human shape of the former is the human shape of 
the latter. The Yagur—Veda is its head, the Rig—Veda is its 
right wing, the Sama—Veda is its left wing, the teaching is its 
trunk, the hymns of Atharva and Angiras are its tail, its support. 


Chapter The Sheath of the Intellect 
1 


"He who knows the Bliss of Brahman, whence all words 
together with the mind turn away, unable to reach it—he never 
fears." 


2 


This sheath of the mind is the embodied soul of the former. 
Verily, the different from this sheath, which consists of the 
essence of the mind, but within it, is another self, which 
consists of the intellect. By this the former is filled. This too 
has the shape of a man. Like the human shape of the former is 
the human shape of the latter. Faith is it head, what is right is its 
right wing, what is truth is its left wing, absorption is its trunk, 
Mahat is its tail, its support. 


Chapter The Sheath of Bliss 
1 


"The intellect accomplishes the sacrifice; it also accomplishes 
all actions. All the gods worship the intellect, who is the eldest, 
as Brahman." 

"Tf a man knows the intellect as Brahman and if he does not 
swerve from it, he leaves behind in the body all evils and 
attains all his desires." 


2 
This is the embodied soul of the former. 
Verily, different from this, which consists of the essence of the 


intellect, but within it, is another self, which consists of bliss. 
By this the former is filled. This too has the shape of a man. 


 


Like the human shape of the former is the human shape of the 
latter. Joy is its head, delight is its right wing, great delight is its 
left, bliss is its trunk. Brahman is its tail, its support. 


Chapter VI—Brahman: The Source of All 


"If a person knows Brahman as non—existent, he himself 
becomes non—existent. If he knows Brahman as existent, then 
know him as existent." 

This is the embodied soul of the former. 

Thereupon the following questions of the pupil: Does anyone 
who knows not attain that World after departing this life? Or 
does he who knows attain that World after departing this life? 
He desired: "May I be many, may I be born. He performed 
austerities. Having performed austerities, He created all this— 
whatever there is. Having created all this, He entered into it. 
Having entered into it, He became both the manifested and the 
unmanifested, both the defined and undefined, both the 
supported and unsupported, both the intelligent and the non— 
intelligent, both the real and the unreal. The Satya became all 
this: whatever there is. Therefore call It the True. 


Chapter VII—Brahman as Fearlessness 


"In the beginning all this was non—existent. From it was born 
what exists. That created Itself by Itself; therefore It is called 
the self—made." 

That which is Self—made is flavour; for truly, on obtaining the 
flavour one becomes blissful. 

Who could direct the prana and the apana if this Bliss did not 
exist in the akasa? Brahman verily exists because It alone 
bestows bliss. 

When a man finds fearless support in That which is invisible, 
incorporeal, indefinable and supportless, he has then obtained 
fearlessness. 

If he makes the slightest differentiation in It, there is fear for 
him. That becomes fear for the knower who does not reflect. 


Chapter VIJI—The Supreme Bliss of Brahman 


"From fear of It the wind blows; from fear of It the sun rises; 
from fear of It Agni and Indra and Death, the fifth, run." 

Now this is an inquiry regarding the Bliss. 

Suppose there is a young man—a noble young man—versed, 
the best of rulers, firm in body and strong and possesses the 
whole world, full of wealth, is his: that is one measure of 
human bliss. 

This human bliss, multiplied on hundred times, is one measure 
of the bliss of the human gandharvas, as also of a man versed in 
the Vedas and free from desires. 


 


This bliss of the human gandharvas, multiplied one hundred 
times, is one measure of the bliss of the celestial gandharvas, as 
also of a man versed in the Vedas and free from desires. 

This bliss of the celestial gandharvas, multiplied one hundred 
times, is one measure of the bliss of the Manes, who dwell in 
the long—enduring world, as also of a man versed in the Vedas 
and free from desires. 

This bliss of the Manes who dwell in the long—enduring 
world, multiplied on hundred times, is one measure of the bliss 
of the gods born in the Ajana heaven, as also of a man versed in 
the Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of the gods born in the Ajana heaven, multiplied one 
hundred times, is one measure of the bliss of the sacrificial 
gods who have attained to divinity by means of sacrifices, as 
also of a man versed in the Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of the sacrificial gods, multiplied one hundred times, 
is one measure of the bliss of the gods, as also of a man versed 
in the Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of the gods, multiplied one hundred times, is one 
measure of the bliss of Indra, as also of a man versed in the 
Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of Indra, multiplied one hundred times, is one 
measure of the bliss of Brihaspati, as also of a man versed in 
the Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of Brihaspati, multiplied one hundred times, is one 
measure of the bliss of Prajapati, as also of a man versed in the 
Vedas and free from desires. 

The bliss of Prajapati, multiplied one hundred times, is one 
measure of the bliss of Brahma, as also of a man versed in the 
Vedas and free from desires. 

He who is here in man and he who is in yonder sun—both are 
one. 

He who knows this, after dying to this world, attains the self 
which consists of food, attains the self which consist of the vital 
breath, attains the self which consists of the mind, attains the 
self which consists of intellect, attains the self which consists of 
bliss. 


Chapter IX—The Merging of Good and Evil in Brahman 


"He who knows the Bliss of Brahman, whence words together 
with the mind turn away, unable to reach It—he is not afraid of 
anything whatsoever." 

He does not distress himself with the thought: Why did I not do 
what is good? Why did I do what is evil? Whosoever knows 
this regards both these as Atman; indeed he cherishes both 
these as Atman. 

Such, indeed, is the Upanishad, the secret knowledge of 
Brahman. 


 


The Peace Chant 


Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 
us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 
Truth! May we cherish no ill—feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Part Three 


Regarding Varuna and Bhrigu 
Chapter I—Definition of Brahman 


Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 
us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 
Truth! May we cherish no ill—feeling toward each other! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


Harih Om. Bhrigu, the son of Varuna, approached his father 
Varuna and said: "Venerable Sir, teach me about Brahman." 

To him, the son, he said this: "Food, the vital breath, the eye, 
the ear, the mind, speech." 

To him he said further: "That from which these beings are born, 
That by which, when born, they live, That into which they 
enter, they merge—seek to know That. That is Brahman." 

He performed austerities. Having performed austerities— 


Chapter II—The Body as Brahman 


He realised that food is Brahman; for from food, verily, are 
these beings born; by food, when born, do they live; into food 
do they enter, do they merge. 

Having realised this, he approached his father again and said: 
"Venerable Sir, teach me Brahman." 

To him, the son, he said this: "Seek to know Brahman by 
means of austerities. For austerities are the means of knowing 
Brahman." 

He practised austerities. Having practised austerities— 


Chapter 11I—The Prana as Brahman 


He realised that the prana is Brahman; for from the prana, 
verily, are these beings born; by the prana, when born, do they 
live; into the prana do they enter, do they merge. 

Having realised this, he approached his father again and said: 
"Venerable Sir, teach me Brahman." 

To him, the son, he said this: "Seek to know Brahman by 


 


means of austerities. For austerities are the means of knowing 
Brahman." 
He practised austerities. Having practised austerities— 


Chapter I1V—The Mind as Brahman 


He realised that the mind is Brahman; for from the mind, 
verily, are these beings born; by the mind, when born, do they 
live; into the mind, at the time of dissoulution, do they enter, do 
they merge. 

Having realised this, he approached his father again and said: 
"Venerable Sir, teach me Brahman." 

To him, the son, he said this: "Seek to know Brahman by 
means of austerities; for austerities are Brahman." 

He practised austerities. Having practised austerities— 


Chapter V—The Intellect as Brahman 


He realised that the intellect (vijnana) is Brahman; for from the 
intellect, verily, are these beings born; by the intellect, when 
born, do they live; into the intellect, at the time of dissolution, 
do they enter, do they merge. 

Having realised this, he approached his father again and said: 
"Venerable Sir, teach me Brahman." 

To him, the son, he said this: "Seek to know Brahman by 
means of austerities; for austerities are the means of knowing 
Brahman." 

He practised austerities. Having practised austerities— 


Chapter VI—Bliss as Brahman 


He realised that Bliss is Brahman; for from Bliss (ananda), 
verily, are these beings born; by bliss, when born, do they live; 
into bliss, at the time of dissolution, do they enter, do they 
merge. 

This is the wisdom taught by Varuna and learnt by Bhrigu. It is 
established in the the supreme akasa, in the heart. He who 
knows this is established in the Bliss of Brahman. He becomes 
a possessor of food and an eater of food. He becomes great in 
offspring and cattle and in spiritual radiance and great in fame. 


Chapter VII—The Importance of Food (1) 


Let him (the knower of Brahman) never condemn food; that is 
the vow. 

The prana is, verily, food; the body is the eater of food. The 
body rests on the prana; the prana rest on the body. Thus food 
rests on food. 

He who knows this resting of food on food is established; he 
becomes a possessor of food and an eater of food. He becomes 


 


great in offspring and cattle and in spiritual radiance and great 
in fame. 


Chapter VIII—The Importance of Food (II) 


Let him (the knower of Brahman) never abandon food; that is 
the vow. 

Water is, verily, food; fire is the eater. Fire rests on water and 
water rests on fire. Thus food rests on food. 

He who knows this resting of food on food is established; he 
becomes a possessor of food and an eater of food. He becomes 
great in offspring and cattle and in spiritual radiance and great 
in fame. 


Chapter IX—The Importance of Food (IID 


Let him (the knower of Brahman) make food plentiful; that is 
the vow. 

The earth is, verily, food; the akasa is the eater. The akasa rests 
on the earth and the earth rests on the akasa. Thus food rests on 
food. 

He who knows this resting of food on food is established; he 
becomes a possessor of food and an eater of food. He becomes 
great in offspring and cattle and in spiritual radiance and great 
in fame. 


Chapter X—Meditation on Brahman 
1 


Let him not deny lodgings to anyone: this is the vow. Therefore 
he should procure much food by any means whatsoever. To 
guests, he should say: "The food has been prepared for you." 

If this food is given first, food comes to the giver first. If this 
food is given in the middle, food comes to the giver in the 
middle. If this food is given last, food comes to the giver last. 


2 


He who knows this obtains the fruit mentioned above. 

One should meditate on Brahman as preservation in speech, as 
acquisition and preservation in the prana (upward breath) and 
the apana (downward breath), as action in the hands, as 
movement (walking) in the feet, as evacuation in the anus. 
These are the meditations on Brahman through actions. 

Next follows the meditation on Brahaman, through the gods: 
One should meditate on Brahman as satisfaction in rain, as 
power in lightning; 


 


3 


As fame in cattle, as light in the stars, as procreation, 
immortality and joy in the organ of generation and as 
everything in the akasa. 

Let him contemplate Brahman as the support and he will be 
supported; let him contemplate Brahman as greatness and he 
will become great; let him contemplate Brahman as the mind 
and he will be endowed with mind. 


4 


Let him contemplate Brahman as adoration and all desires will 
fall down before him in adoration. Let him contemplate 
Brahman as the Supreme Lord and he will be endowed with 
supremacy. Let him contemplate Brahman as the destructive 
agent and his enemies who hate him and also those who do not 
hate him will perish. 

This he who is in this man and that he who is in yonder sun, 
both are one. 


5 


He who knows this, as described above, after dying to (i.e. 
withdrawing from) this world, attains the self which consists of 
food, attains the self which consists of the vital breath, attains 
the self which consists of the mind, attains the self which 
consists of the intellect, attains the self which consists of bliss. 
Then he goes up and down these worlds, eating the food he 
desires, assuming the forms he likes. He sits, singing the chant 
of the non—duality of Brahman: "Ah! Ah! Ah!" 


6 


"I am food, I am food, I am food! I am the eater of food, I am 
the eater of food, I am the eater of food! I am the uniter, I am 
the uniter, I am the uniter! 

"I am the first—born of the true, prior to the gods and the navel 
of Immortality. He who gives me away, he alone preserves me. 
He who eats food—lI, as food, eat him. 

"I, as the Supreme Lord, overpower the whole world. I am 
radiant as the sun." 

Whosoever knows this, attains Liberation. Such, indeed, is the 
Upanishad. 


The Peace Chant 
Om. May Brahman protect us both! May Brahman bestow upon 


us both the fruit of Knowledge! May we both obtain the energy 
to acquire Knowledge! May what we both study reveal the 


 


Truth! May we cherish no ill—feeling toward each other! 
Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


End of Taittiriya Upanishad 
Invocation 


Om. May the different limbs of my body, my tongue, prana, 
eyes, ears and my strength and also all the other sense—organs 
be nourished! All, indeed, is Brahman, as is declared in the 
Upanishads. May I never deny Brahman! May Brahman never 
deny me! May there never be denial on my part! May all the 
virtues described in the Upanishads belong to me, who am 
devoted to Atman! Yea, may they all belong to me! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace! 


 


Chhandogya Upanishad 


Part One 
Chapter I—Meditation on Om 
1 


The syllable Om, called the Udgitha, should be meditated upon; 
for people sing the Udgitha, beginning with Om. 
Now follows the detailed explanation of the syllable: 


2 


The essence of all these beings is the earth; the essence of the 
earth is water; the essence of water is plants; the essence of 
plants is a person; essence of a person is speech; the essence of 
speech is the Rig—Veda; essence of the Rig—Veda is the 
Sama—vVeda; the essence of the Sama—Veda is the Udgitha 
which is Om. 


3 


That Udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the supreme, 
deserving the highest place, the eighth. 


4 


What, then, is the Rik? What is the Saman? What is the 
Udgitha? This is to be considered. 


5 

Speech, indeed, is the Rik; the vital breath (prana) is the 
Saman; the syllable Om is the Udgitha. Speech and the prana, 
or the Rik and the Saman, form a couple. 


6 


And that couple become united in the syllable Om. When a pair 
come together they fulfil each other's desire. 


7 
He who knows this as stated above and meditates on the 


syllable Om, the Udgitha, becomes, indeed, a fulfiller of 
desires. 


 


8 


This syllable Om is used to give assent, for wherever one 
assents to something, one says Om (yes). Now, what is assent is 
gratification. He who knows this and meditates on the syllable 
Om, the Udgitha, becomes, indeed, a gratifier of desires. 


9 


By means of this syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. 
When adhvaryu priest gives an order in a sacrifice, he says Om. 
When the hotri priest recites the hymn, he says Om. When the 
udgatri priest sings the Saman, he says Om. All this is done for 
the glory of the Imperishable Atman by the greatness of that 
syllable and by its essence. 


10 


It may be contended that he who knows this true meaning of 
the syllable Om and he who does not, perform the same 
sacrifice and therefore must reap the same fruit. But this is not 
so. The results of knowledge and ignorance are different. Work 
that is done with knowledge, faith and the Upanishad (i.e. 
meditation on the deities) produces more powerful fruit. 

This is, verily, the detailed explanation of the syllable Om. 


Chapter II — Meditation on Om as the Prana 
1 


When the gods and the demons, both offspring of Prajapati, 
fought with each other, the gods took hold of the Udgitha, 
thinking that with this they would vanquish the demons. 


2 


They (i.e. the gods) meditated on the Udgitha (Om) as the 
prana which functions through the nose. But the demons 
pierced it (i.e. the prana) with evil. Therefore with it (i.e. the 
breath) one smells both what is pleasant—smelling and what is 
foul—smelling. For the breath is pierced by evil. 


3 
Then they meditated on the Udgitha as speech. But the demons 


pierced it with evil. Therefore one speaks both truth and 
falsehood. For speech is pierced by evil. 


 


4 


Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the eye. But the demons 
pierced it with evil. Therefore one sees both what is sightly and 
what is unsightly. For the eye is pierced by evil. 


5 


Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the ear. But the demons 
pierced it with evil. Therefore one hears both what is worth 
hearing and what is not worth hearing. For the ear is pierced by 
evil. 


6 


Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the mind. But the 
demons pierced it with evil. Therefore one thinks both proper 
and improper thoughts. For the mind is pierced by evil. 


7 


Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the principal (mukhya) 
prana. But as a clod of earth hitting a stone is scattered, even so 
the demons were destroyed when they hit it. 


8 


As a clod of earth is scattered when hitting a stone, thus will he 
be scattered who wishes evil to one who knows this or who 
injures him; for he is a solid stone. 


9 


With this (i.e. the principal vital breath) one does not discern 
what pleasant—smelling and what is foul—smelling; for it is 
unsmitten by evil. Whatever a person eats or drinks with it (the 
principal vital breath) supports the other pranas. That is why 
they depart when, at the time death, it no longer supports them 
by eating and drinking. It opens the mouth at the time of death 
as if the dying man wished to eat. 


10—13 


Angira meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. people 
call it (1.e. the prana) Angiras, because it is the essence (rasa) of 
the limbs (anga). 

Brihaspati meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. 
People call it (the prana) Brihaspati, because speech is great 
(brihat) and it is the lord (pati) of speech. 

Ayasya meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. People 


 


call it (the prana) as Ayasya; because it comes (ayate) from the 
mouth (asya). 

Vaka, the son of Dalbhya, knew it (the prana); he became the 
udgatri priest of the sacrificers dwelling in the Naimisha forest. 
By singing the Udgitha he fulfilled all their desires. 


14 


He who knows this as described above and meditates upon the 
imperishable Udgitha (Om) obtains all his desires by singing 
the Udgitha. 

So much for the Udgitha as meditates on with reference to the 
body. 


Chapter III — Meditation on the Udgitha as the Sun and 
the Vyana 


1 


Now is described the meditation on the Udgitha with reference 
to the gods: 

One should meditate on the Udgitha as the sun who gives 
warmth. When he (the sun) rises he sings the Udgitha for the 
benefit of all creatures. When he rises he destroys darkness and 
fear. He who knows this becomes the destroyer of darkness and 
fear. 


2 


This prana and that sun are the same. This is warm and that is 
warm. This they call svara (what goes out) and that, pratyasvara 
(what returns). Therefore one should meditate on the Udgitha 
as this and that. 


3 


One should meditate on the Udgitha as the vyana. That which 
one breathes out is the prana and that which one breathes in is 
the apana. That which is the junction of the prana and the apana 
is the Vyana. This vyana is speech. Therefore when one utters 
speech one stops the prana and the apana. 


4 


That which is speech is the Rik. Therefore when a man utters a 
Rik he neither breathes out nor breathes in. That which is the 
Rik is the Saman. Therefore when a man sings a Saman, he 
neither breathes out nor breathes in. That which is the Saman is 
the Udgitha. Therefore when a man sings the Udgitha he 
neither breathes out nor breathes in. 


) 


5 


And other works also which require strength, such as the 
kindling of fire by rubbing, running a race and stringing a 
strong bow, are performed without breathing out or breathing 
in. Therefore one should meditate on the Udgitha as the vyana. 


6 


One should meditate on the letters of the word Udgitha (i.e. ut, 
gi and tha). Ut is the prana, for a man rises (uttishthati) by 
means of the prana. Gi is speech, for speeches are called girah. 
Tha is food, for all this subsists (sthita) on food. 


7 


Ut is heaven, gi the mid—region and tha the earth. Ut is the 
sun, gi the air and tha fire. Ut is the Sama—Veda, gi the 
Yajur—Veda and tha the Rig—Veda. To him who thus 
meditates speech yields milk and milk is speech. He who 
knows this and meditates on the letters of the Udgitha becomes 
the possessor of food and the eater of food. 


8 


Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. One should thus 
meditate on the object one wishes to obtain through meditation: 
he (i.e. the udgatri priest) should meditate on the Saman with 
which he is going chant the praise. 


9 

He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the Rik in which that 
Saman occurs, on the rishi to whom it was revealed and on the 
deity whom he is going to praise. 

10 

He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the metre in which 
he is going to chant the praise; he should meditate on the hymn 
by which he is going to chant the praise. 

11 


He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the quarter of space 
facing which he is going to chant the praise. 


, 


12 


Finally, he (the udgatri priest) should meditate on himself and 
then on the object desired and chant the praise correctly. Thus 
will be quickly fulfilled for him the desire, desiring which he 
may offer the hymn of praise, yea, desiring which he may offer 
the hymn of praise. 


Chapter IV — Meditation on Om as Fearlessness and 
Immortality 


1 


The syllable Om, called the Udgitha, should be meditated upon; 
for people sing the Udgitha, beginning with Om. 
Now follows the detailed explanation of this syllable. 


2 


The gods, afraid of death, entered upon the threefold 
knowledge. They covered themselves with the metrical hymns. 
Because they covered (acchadayan) themselves with the 
hymns, the hymns are called chhandas. 


3 


As a fisherman might observe a fish in shallow water, so death 
observed the gods in the Rik, the Yajus and the Saman. They 
too came to know this, rose from the Rik, the Yajus and the 
Saman and entered the Svara (Om) alone. 


4 


When a man has mastered the Rig—Veda he loudly utters Om; 
he does the same when he has mastered the Sama—Veda and 
the Yajur—Veda. The Svara is the syllable Om; it is immortal 
and fearless. The gods, by entering it, became immortal and 
fearless. 


5 
He who, knowing this, sings the praise of the syllable Om 
enters this same syllable, called the Svara, which is immortal 


and fearless. Having entered it, he becomes immortal as the 
gods are immortal. 


 


Chapter V — Meditation on Om as the Sun and the Prana 
1 


Now, verily, that which is the Udgitha is the Pranava; that 
which is the Pranava is the Udgitha. Yonder sun is the Udgitha. 
It is the Pranava, because it moves along uttering Om. 


2 


Kaushitaki in olden times said to his son: "I sang the praise of 
the sun regarding it as one with its rays; therefore you are my 
only son. Meditate on the rays and the sun as different from 
each another and you will have many sons." 

So much with reference to the gods. 


3 


Now with reference to the body: 
One should meditate on the Udgitha as the principal prana, for 
(i.e. the prana) moves in the body uttering Om. 


4 


Kaushitaki in olden times said to his son: "I sang the praise of 
the principal prana alone; therefore you are my only son. 
Meditate on the Udgitha as the manifold prana and you will 
have many sons." 


Ss 


Now, verily, that which is the Udgitha is the Pranava; that 
which is the Pranava is the Udgitha. He (i.e. the udgatri priest) 
who knows this, rectifies from the seat of the hotri priest any 
mistake committed by him (the udgatri priest), yea he rectifies 
it. 

Chapter VI — The Luminous Person in the Solar Orb 

1 

This earth is the Rik and fire is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. 
fire) rests on that Rik (i.e. the earth). Therefore the Saman is 
sung resting on the Rik. Sa is the earth, ama is fire; thus they 
(the earth and fire) are designated as Sama. 

2 

The mid—region is the Rik and the air is the Saman. This 


Saman (i.e. the air) rests on that Rik (i.e. the mid—tregion). 


 


Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the 
mid—region, ama is the air; thus they (the mid—region and the 
air) are designated as Sama. 


4 


The stars are the Rik and the moon is the Saman. This Saman 
(i.e. the moon) rests on that Rik (i.e. the stars). Therefore the 
Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the stars, ama is the 
moon; thus they (the stars and the moon) are designated as 
Sama. 


5 


Now, the white radiance of the sun is the Rik and its blue 
intense darkness is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. the darkness) 
rests on that Rik (i.e. the radiance). Therefore the Saman is 
sung, resting on the Rik. 


6—7 


Sa is the white radiance of the sun, ama is its blue intense 
darkness; thus they (the radiance and the darkness) are 
designated as Sama. 

Now, the golden person who is seen in the sun, who has a 
golden beard and golden hair, who is golden to the very tips of 
his nails—his eyes are like a lotus flower, red as the rump of a 
monkey. 

His name is Ut, for he has risen (udita) above all evil. He, too, 
who knows this rises above all evil. 


Chapter VII — The Person in the Eye 
1 


Now with reference to the body: 

Speech is the Rik and the prana is the Saman. This Saman (the 
prana) rests on that Rik (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung, 
resting on the Rik. Sa is speech, ama is the prana; thus they 
(speech and the prana) are designated as Sama. 


2 
The eye is the Rik and the atman is the Saman. This Saman (the 
atman) rests on that Rik (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung, 


resting on the Rik. Sa is the eye, ama is the atman; thus they 
(the eye and the atman) are designated as Saman. 


 


3 


The ear is the Rik and the mind is the Saman. This Saman (the 

mind) rests on that Rik (the ear). Therefore the Saman is sung, 

resting on the Rik. Sa is the ear, ama is the mind; thus they (the 
ear and the mind) are designated as Sama. 


4 


Now, the white radiance of the eye is the Rik and its blue 
intense darkness is the Saman. This Saman (darkness) rests on 
that Rik (radiance). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the 
Rik. Sa is the white radiance of the eye, ama is its blue intense 
darkness; thus they (the radiance and the darkness) are 
designated as Sama. 


5 


Now, the person who is seen in the eye is the Rik, he is the 
Saman, he is the Uktha, he is the Yajus, he is Brahman. The 
form of this person in the eye is the same as the form of that 
person in the sun. The joints this person in the eye are the same 
as the joints of that person in the sun; the name of this one (Ut) 
is the same as the name of that one. 


6 


He is the lord of the worlds which spread beneath that (i.e. the 
eye) and also of all the wishes of men. Therefore all who sing 
to the vina sing of him and from him they obtain wealth. 


7 


He who, knowing this (i.e. the Udgitha), sings the Saman, sings 
both. Through that (i.e. the person in the sun) he obtains the 
world beyond that (i.e. the sun) and the wishes of the gods. 


8—9 


Likewise, through this (i.e. the person in the eye), he obtains 
the worlds that spread beneath that (i.e. the eye) and all the 
wishes of men. 

Therefore an udgatri priest who knows this may say to the 
sacrificer for whom he acts as priest: 

"What desire of yours shall I fulfil by singing?" 

For he who, knowing this, sings the Saman is able to fulfil 
wishes through his singing of the Saman, yea, through his 
singing of the Saman. 


 


Chapter VIII — The Story of the Pravahana (I) 
1 


There were three men versed in the Udgitha: Silaka the son of 
Salavat, Chaikitayana of the line of Dalbhya and Pravahana the 
son of Jivala. They said: "We are indeed versed in the Udgitha. 
Let us have a discussion of the Udgitha." 


2 


"Let it be so," they said and sat down. Then Pravihana the son 
Jivala said: "Revered Sirs, you speak first and I shall listen to 
what the two brahmins have to say." 


2 


Then Silaka the son of Salavat said to Chaikitayana of the line 
Dalbhya: "Well, may I question you?" 
"Do ask," he said. 


4—5 


"What is the support of the Saman?" 

"Tone (svara)," he replied. 

"What is the support of tone?" 

"The prana (vital breath)," he replied. 

"What is the support of the prana?" 

"Food," he replied. "What is the support of food?" 
"Water," he replied. 

"What is the support of water?" 

"Yonder world (heaven)," he replied. 

"What is the support of yonder world?" 

"Let no one carry the Saman beyond the heavenly world. We 
place the Saman in the heavenly world, for the Saman is 
praised as heaven." 


6 


Then Silaka the son of Salavat said to Chaikitayana of the line 
of Dalbhya: "O Dalbhya your Saman is not firmly established. 
If at this ttme anyone who knew the support of the Saman were 
to say: 'Your head shall fall off;' surely your head would fall 
off." 


7 
"Well then, revered Sir, let me learn it from you," said 


Chaikitayana. 
"Learn it," replied Silaka. 


 


"What is the support of that world?" 

"This world," he replied. 

"What is the support of this world?" 

"Let no one carry the Saman beyond this world, which is its 
support. 

We place the Saman in this world as its support, for the Saman 
is praised as the support (i.e. this world)." 


8 


Then said Pravahana the son of Jivala: O son of Salavat, your 
Saman (i.e. this earth) has an end. If at this time anyone who 
knew the support of the Saman were to say: 'Your head shall 
fall off,' surely your head would fall off." 

"Well then, let me learn this from you, revered Sir," said 
Silaka. 

"Learn it," said Pravahana. 


Chapter IX — The Story of Pravahana (ID) 
1 


"What is the support of this world?" asked Silaka. 

"The akasa," said Pravahana. "For all these beings are created 
from the akasa and return to the akasa. The akasa is greater 
than these; therefore the akasa is the supreme support." 


2 


This is the Udgitha (Om), the most excellent; this is endless. 
He who, knowing this, meditates on the Udgitha obtains the 
most excellent life and wins the most excellent worlds. 


34 


Atidhanvan the son of Sunaka, having taught this Udgitha to 
Udarasandilya, said: "As long as any of your descendants know 
this Udgitha, their life shall be the most excellent in this world 
and likewise in the other world." 

He who thus knows the Udgitha and meditates on it—his life 
shall be the most excellent in this world and likewise in the 
other world, yea, the other world. 


Chapter X — The Story of Ushasti (I) 
1 


When the crops of the Kurus were destroyed by thunderstorms, 
Ushasti the son of Chakra, with his child—wife, lived in a 


 


deplorable condition in the village of a man who owned an 
elephant. 


2 


He (Ushasti) begged food from the owner of the elephant, who 
was eating some wretched beans. He (the owner of the 
elephant) said: "I have nothing but what is set before me." 


3 


Ushasti said: "Give me these." 

He gave the beans and said: "Here is some water left over from 
my drinking." 

Ushasti said: "If I drink this, I will then be drinking what has 
been left by another." 


4 


The owner of the elephant said: "Were not those beans also left 
over and therefore unclean?" 

Ushasti replied: "I should not have lived if I had not eaten 
them; but I can get water wherever I like." 


5 


Having himself eaten, Ushasti gave his wife what was left. But 
she, having eaten before, took them (i.e. the beans) and put 
them away. 


6 


Next morning, on awaking, he said: "Alas, if I could get even 
little a to eat, I might earn some money. The king over here is 
going to perform a sacrifice; he would choose me for all the 
priestly offices." 


7 

His wife said to him: "Here, my husband, are the beans." After 
eating them, he went to the sacrifice that was about to be 
performed. 

8 

He saw there the assembled udgatri priests and sat near them in 


place where they would sing the hymns. He said to the prastotri 
priest: 


 


9 


"O prastotri priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to 
Prastiva, you sing the Prastiva, your head will fall off" 


10—11 


In the same manner he addressed the udgatri priest: "O udgatri 
priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to the Udgitha, 
you sing the Udgitha, your head will fall off." 

In the same manner he addressed the pratihartri priest: "O 
pratihartri priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to 
the Pratihara, you sing the Pratihara, your head will fall off." 
They all stopped performing their duties and sat in silence. 


Chapter XI — The Story of Ushasti (II) 
1 


The sacrificer said to him (Ushasti): "I should like to know who 
you are, revered Sir." 
"Tam Ushasti the son of Chakra," he replied. 


2 


He (the sacrificer) said: "Revered Sir, I looked for you to 
perform all these priestly offices, but not finding you, Sir, I 
have chosen others." 


3 


"But now, Sir, please take up all the priestly offices." 

"So be it," said Ushasti, "but let these priests, with my 
permission, sing the hymns of praise. You will, however, give 
me as much wealth as you give them." 

"So be it," said the sacrificer. 


4 
Thereupon the prastotri priest approached him and said: "Sir, 
you said to me: 'O prastotri priest, if without knowing the deity 
that belongs to the Prastava, you sing the Prastava, your head 
will fall off.' Which is that deity?" 

5 

Ushasti said: "The prana is that deity. For all these beings 


merge in the prana alone and from the prana alone do they rise. 
This is deity which belongs to the Prastava. If without knowing 


 


him you chanted the Prastava after having been cursed by me, 
your head would have fallen off." 


6 


Then the udgatri priest approached him and said: "Sir, you said 
to me: 'O udgatri priest, if without knowing the deity that 
belongs to the Udgitha, you sing the Udgitha, your head will 
fall off.' Which is that deity?" 


7 


Ushasti said: "The sun is that deity. For all these beings praise 
the sun which is high up. This is the deity which belongs to the 
Udgitha. If without knowing him you had chanted the Udgitha 
after having been cursed by me, your head would have fallen 
off." 


8 


Then the pratihartri priest approached him and said: "Sir, you 
said to me: "O pratihartri priest, if without knowing the deity 
that belongs to the Pratihara, you sing the Pratihara, your head 
will fall off.' Which is that deity?" 


9 

Ushasti said: "Food is that deity. For all these beings take food 
and live. This is the deity that belongs to the Pratihara. If 
without knowing him you had chanted the Pratihara after 
having been cursed by me, your head would have fallen off." 
Chapter XII — The Udgitha of the Dogs 

1 

Now follows the Udgitha of the dogs: 

One day, Vaka the son of Dalbhya, or as he was also called, 
Glava son of Mitra, went forth to study the Vedas. 

2 

A white dog appeared before him. Other dogs, gathering 


around, said to him (i.e. the white dog): "Revered Sir, please 
sing for us, so we may obtain food; we are hungry." 


 


3 


He (the white dog) said to them: "Come to me here tomorrow 
morning." Vaka the son of Dalbhya, or as he was also called, 
Glava son of Mitra, kept watch. 


4 


Just as the priests move along, holding to one another, when 
they are about to sing praises with the Vahishpavamana hymn, 
so did the dogs move along. Then they sat down and uttered the 
syllable Him. 


5 


Om. Let us eat! Om. Let us drink! Om. Let the sun, who is the 
luminous deity (deva), the giver of rain (Varuna), the lord of 
creatures (Prajapati), bring food here! 

Now a prayer to the sun: O lord of food, bring food here, bring 
it here. Om. 


Chapter XIII — The Mystical Meaning of the Stobha 
Syllables 


1 


This Earth is verily the syllable hau; the air is the syllable hai; 
the moon is the syllable atha; the self is the syllable iha; the fire 
is the syllable 1. 


2 


The sun is the syllable u; the invocation is the syllable e; the 
Visve—devas are the syllable au—ho—i; Prajapati is the 
syllable him; the prana the syllable svara; food is the syllable 
ya; Virat is the syllable vak. 


3 


Indefinable is the thirteenth stobha, namely, the variable 
syllable hum. 


4 
To him who knows this secret knowledge of the Samans, 
speech yields milk and milk is speech. He becomes the 


possessor of food and the eater of food—he who knows this, 
yea, he who knows this. 


 


Part Two 
Chapter 1 — Meditation on the Fivefold Saman (I) 
1 


Om. Meditation on the whole of the Saman is good. Whatever 
is good, people say it is Saman; and whatever is not good, 
people say it is not Saman. 


2 


Thus people say: "He approached him with Saman," that is to 
say, "He approached him in a becoming manner." Again they 
say: "He approached him without Saman," that is to say, "He 
approached him in an unbecoming manner." 


3 


And they also say: "Truly this is Saman for us," that is to say, 
"It is good for us," when it is good. Again, they say: "Truly this 
is not Saman for us," that is to say, "It is not good for us," when 
it is not good. 


4 


He who, knowing this, meditates on the Saman as good—all 
good qualities will approach him quickly, ay, they will accrue 
to him.

who, knowing this, meditates on the fivefold Saman as rain. 


Chapter IV — Meditation on the Fivefold Saman as Water

One should meditate on the fivefold Saman in all the waters. 
When the clouds gather, that is the syllable Him; when it rains, 
that the Prastava; the rivers which flow to the east, these are the 
Udgitha; the rivers which flow to the west, these are the 
Pratihara; the ocean is Nidhana.

knowing this, meditates on the fivefold Saman in all the waters.

Saman in animals. 


Chapter VII — Meditation on the Fivefold Saman as the

(the eye), the Pratihara hearing (the ear), the Nidhana the mind. 
These are each greater than the preceding.

fivefold Saman, which is the most excellent, as the senses. 


Chapter VIII — Meditation on the Sevenfold Saman in

Now for the sevenfold Saman: 

One should meditate on the sevenfold Saman in speech. When 
there is the syllable Hum in speech, that is the syllable Him; 
likewise Pra is the Prastava, A is the Adi. 

2 


Ud is the Udgitha, Pra the Pratihara, Upa the Upadrava, Ni the

meditates on the sevenfold Saman in speech. 


Chapter IX — Meditation on the Sevenfold Saman as the 
Sun 


1 


One should meditate on the sevenfold Saman as yonder sun. 
The sun is the Saman because he is always the same (sama). He 
is the Saman because he makes everyone cherish the same 
thought: "He faces me," "He faces me." 


2 


One should know that all beings depend upon him (i.e. the sun). 
What he is before his rising is the syllable Him. The animals 
depend upon it (i.e. Him). Therefore the animals say "Him" 
before the sunrise, for they partake of the syllable Him of the 
Saman (sun). 


a 


What he (the sun) is just after he has risen, that is the Prastava. 
Men depend upon it. Therefore men love praise (prastuti) and 
eulogy, for they partake of the Prastava of that Saman. 


4 


What he is when the rays go forth, that is the Adi. Birds depend 
upon It. Therefore birds hold themselves without support in the 
sky and fly about, for they partake of the Adi of that Saman. 


5 


What he is just at midday, that is the Udgitha. The devas (gods) 
are dependent upon it. Therefore they are the best of the 
offspring of Prajapati, for they partake of the Udgitha of that Sa 
man. 


6 


What he is after midday and before afternoon, that is the 
Pratihara. The foetuses depend upon it. Therefore they are held 
in the womb after being conceived and do not fall, for they 
partake of the Pratihara of the Saman. 


 


a 


What he is after the afternoon and before sunset, that is the 
Upadrava. The animals of the forest depend upon it. Therefore 
they run (upadravanti) to the forest and their caves when they 
see a man, for partake of the Upadrava of that Saman. 


8 


What he is just after the sunset, that is the Nidhana. The Manes 
depend upon it. Therefore they put them (i.e. the Manes) down 
(nidadhati), for they partake of the Nidhana of that Saman. 
Thus a man meditates on the sevenfold Saman as the sun. 


Chapter X — Meditation on the Sevenfold Saman through 
the Number of Syllables 


1 


Next one should meditate on the sevenfold Saman which has a 
uniform number of syllables and which leads beyond death: 
The word Himkara has three syllables, the word Prastava has 
three syllables. 

Hence they are equal (sama). 


2 


The word Adi has two syllables and the word Pratihara has four 
syllables. If we take one syllable from Pratihara and join to 
Adi, they become equal (sama). 


34 


The word Udgitha has three syllables and the word Upadrava 
has four syllables. With three and three syllables they should be 
equal. One syllable being left out, it becomes trisyllabic. Hence 
the equality (sama). 

The word Nidhana has three syllables; therefore it is equal. 
These make twenty—two syllables of the sevenfold Saman. 


5 
With twenty—one syllables he reaches the sun; for the sun is 
the twenty—first from here. With the twenty—second he 


conquers what is beyond the sun; that plane is blessed and free 
from grief. 


 


6 


He obtains here victory over the sun (death); and to him comes 
victory higher than the victory over the sun who, knowing this,

syllables and which leads beyond death, yea, who meditates 
upon the sevenfold Saman.

2 


He who thus knows this Saman as interwoven in everything 
becomes everything. 


3 


On this there is the following verse: "There are the fivefold 
three. Greater than these or besides these there is nothing." 


 


4 


He who knows this, knows everything. All regions bring him 


gifts. 

Chapter XXII — The different notes employed in the 
Chanting of the Saman 

1 


An Udgatri priest thinks thus: "I choose the deep—sounding 
note of the Saman, which is good for the cattle and which 
belongs to fire (Agni). The undefined note belongs to Prajapati, 
the defined note to Soma (the moon), the soft and smooth note 
to Vayu (the air), the smooth and strong note to Indra, the 
heron—like note to Brihaspati and dull note to Varuna." Let a 
man cultivate all these, avoiding, however, the note of Varuna. 


2 


A man should sing, wishing that by his song he may secure 
immortality for the gods: "May I obtain by my song oblations 
(svadha) for the Manes, hope for men, grass and water for 
cattle, heaven for the sacrificer and food for myself." Thus 
reflecting on all these in his mind, he (the udgatri priest) should 
chant the praises without making mistakes in pronunciation etc. 


3 


All vowels belong to the different parts of Indra's body, all 
sibilants to Prajapati, all consonants to Mrityu (death). If 
someone should reprove him (i.e. the udgatri priest who knows 
this) regarding the pronunciation of vowels, let him say: "I 
went to Indra for my refuge when pronouncing my vowels. He 
will answer you." 


4 


And if someone should reprove him for his sibilants, let him 
say: "I went to Prajapati for my refuge. He will smash you." 
And if someone should reprove him for his consonants, let him 
say" I went to Mrityu for my refuge. He will burn you to 
ashes." 


S 
All vowels should be pronounced with resonance and strength 
and with the thought on the part of the singer: "May I impart 


strength to Indra (the prana)." All the sibilants should be 
pronounced full—without being swallowed or thrown out and 


? 


with the thought: "May I give myself to Prajapati." All 
consonants should be pronounced slowly and without mixing 
them with the others and with the thought: "May I withdraw 
myself from death." 


Chapter XXIII — Praise of Om Unassociated with any 
Ritual 


1 


There are three divisions of dharma: Sacrifice, study and 
charity form the first. Austerity is the second. Dwelling in the 
house of the teacher as a brahmacharin, always mortifying the 
body in the house of the teacher, is the third. All those who 
practise these dharmas attain the worlds of the virtuous. But 
one who is established in Brahman obtains Immortality. 


2 


Prajapati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded 
upon, there was revealed in his heart the threefold knowledge. 
He brooded on it and from it, thus brooded upon, there issued 
forth these syllables: Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah. 


3 


He brooded on them (the three syllables) and from them, thus 
brooded upon, there issued forth Om. As all leaves are held 
together by a midrib, so is all speech held together by Om 
(brahman). Om is all thus, yea, On is all this. 


Chapter XXIV — The Different Planes attained by the 
Sacrificer 


1—2 


The expounders of Brahman (i.e. the Vedas) ask: "Since the 
morning oblation belongs to the Vasus, the midday oblation to 
the Rudras and the third (i.e. evening) oblation to the Adityas 
and the Visve—devas, 

"Where, then, is the world of the sacrificer?" He who does not 
know this, how can he perform the sacrifice? Only he who 
knows should perform it. 


3—4 
Before beginning the morning chant, the sacrificer, sitting 


behind the Garhapatya Fire and facing the north, sings the 
Saman addressed to the Vasus: 


 


"O Fire! Open the door of the earth—world. Let us see thee, 
that we may rule this earth. 


5—6 


Then the sacrificer offers an oblation, reciting thus: "Adoration 
to Agni, who dwells in the earth—world! Secure this world for 
me, the sacrificer. That is the world for the sacrificer. 

"I, the sacrificer, will go thither when this life is over. Svaha!" 
Afterwards the sacrificer chants: "Cast away the bolt of the 
earth—world." Having said this, he rises. To him the Vasus 
offer the world connected with the morning oblation. 


7—8 


Before beginning the midday oblation, the sacrificer, sitting 
behind the Dakshina Fire and facing the north, sings the Saman 
addressed to the Rudras: 

"O Fire! Open the door of the sky—world. Let us see thee, that 
we may rule wide in the sky—world." 


9—10 


Then the sacrificer offers an oblation, reciting thus: "Adoration 
to Vayu, who dwells in the sky—world! Secure this world for 
me, the sacrificer. That is the world for the sacrificer. 

"I, the sacrificer, will go thither when this life is over. Svaha!" 
Afterwards the sacrificer chants: "Cast away the bolt of the 
sky—world." Having said this, he rises. To him the Rudras 
offer the world connected with the midday oblation. 


11—13 


Before beginning the third (i.e. evening) oblation, the sacrificer, 
sitting behind the Ahavaniya Fire and facing the north, sings 
the two Samans addressed to the Adityas and the Visve— 
devas: 

"O Fire! Open the door of the heaven—world. Let us see thee, 
that we may rule supreme in heaven." This is addressed to the 
Adityas. 

Next the Saman addressed to the Visve—devas: "O Fire! Open 
the door of the heaven—world. Let us see thee, that we may 
rule supreme in heaven." 


14—15 
Then the sacrificer offers an oblation, reciting thus: "Adoration 
to Adityas and the Visve—devas, who dwell in the heaven— 


world! Secure this world for me, the sacrificer. That is the 
world for the sacrificer. 


 


"I, the sacrificer, will go thither when this life is over. Svaha! 
Afterwards the sacrificer chants: "Cast away the bolt of the 
heaven—world." Having said this, he rises. 


16 


To him the Adityas and the Visve—devas offer the world 
connected with the third oblation. He (the sacrificer) who 
knows this knows the measure of the sacrifice, yea, he knows 
it. 


Part Three 
Chapter 1 — The Honey—Doctrine (Rig—Veda) 
1 


Yonder sun is, verily, the honey of the gods. Heaven is the 
cross—beam. The mid—region is the hive. The particles of 
water—vapours drawn by the sun through its rays are the eggs. 


2—3 


The eastern rays of the sun are the eastern honey—cells. The 
Rik—verses are the bees. The ritual laid down in the Rig— 
Veda is the flower. The water of the sacrificial libations is the 
nectar of the flower. 

These Riks heated the Rig—Veda. From it, thus heated, issued 
forth—as its essence—fame, radiance of the body, vigour of 
the senses, virility and the food that is eaten. 


4 


That essence flowed forth and went toward the sun and that 
forms what is called the red colour of the rising sun. 


Chapter II — The Honey—Doctrine (Yajur—Veda) 

1 

The southern rays of the sun are the southern honey—cells. The 
Yajus—verses are the bees. The ritual laid down in the Yajur— 
Veda is the flower. The water of the sacrificial libation is the 
nectar of the flower. 

2 

These Yajus—verses heated the Yajur—vVeda. From it, thus 


heated, issued forth—as its essence—fame, radiance of the 
body, vigour of the senses, virility and the food that is eaten. 


 


3 


That essence flowed forth and went toward the sun. That forms 
what is called the white colour of the sun. 


Chapter III — The Honey—Doctrine (Sama—Veda) 
1 


The western rays of the sun are the western honey—cells. The 
Saman—verses are the bees. The Sama—Veda is the flower. 
The water is the nectar. 


2 


The Samans heated the Sama—Veda. From it, thus heated, 
issued forth—as its essence—fame, radiance, vigour of the 
senses, virility and the food that is eaten. 


3 


That flowed forth and went toward the sun. called the dark 
colour of the sun. 


Chapter IV — The Honey—Doctrine (Atharva—Veda) 

1 

The northern rays of the sun are the northern honey—cells. The 
verses of the Atharvangirasa are the bees. The Itihasa—purana 
is the flower. The water is the nectar. 

2 

These very hymns of the Atharvangirasa heated the Itihasa— 
purana. From it, thus heated, issued forth—as its essence— 
fame, radiance, vigour of the senses, virility and the food that is 
eaten. 


3 


That flowed forth and went toward the sun. That forms what is 
called the extremely dark colour of the sun. 


 


Chapter V — The Honey—Doctrine (Continued) 
1 


Now, the upward rays of the sun are the honey—cells above. 
The secret teachings of the Upanishads are the bees. Brahman 
(Om) is flower. The water is the nectar. 


2 


These secret teachings as the bees heated Brahman (Om). From 
It, thus heated, issued forth—as Its essence—fame, radiance, 
vigour of the senses, virility and the food that is eaten. 


3 


That flowed forth and went towards the sun. That forms what 
appears to stir in the centre of the sun. 


4 


These different colours in the sun are the essences of the 
essences; for the Vedas are the essences and these colours are, 
again, their essences. These are the nectars of the nectars; for 
the Vedas are the nectars (i.e. immortal) and of them these 
colours in the sun are the nectars. 


Chapter VI — Meditation on the Vasus 

1 

On the first of these nectars the Vasus live, with Agni (fire) at 
their head. Truly, the gods do not eat or drink. They are 
satisfied by merely looking at the nectar. 

2 

They retire into that red colour and rise up from that colour. 

3 

He who thus knows this nectar becomes one of the Vasus, with 
Agni (fire) at their head; he is satisfied by merely looking at the 
nectar. He retires into that red colour and again rises up from 
that colour. 

4 

As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, so long 


does he, like the Vasus, enjoy rulership and sovereignty. 


 


Chapter VII — Meditation on the Rudras 
1 


On the second of these nectars the Rudras live, with Indra at 
their head. Truly, the gods do not eat or drink. They are 
satisfied by merely looking at the nectar. 


2 
They retire into that white colour and rise up from that colour. 
3 


He who thus knows this nectar becomes one of the Rudras, 
with Indra at their head; he is satisfied by merely looking at the 
nectar. He retires into that white colour and again rises up from 
that colour. 


4 


As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, twice as 
long does it rise in the south and set in the north and just so 
long does he, like the Rudras, enjoy rulership and sovereignty. 


Chapter VIII — Meditation on the Adityas 

1 

On the third of these nectars the Adityas live, with Varuna at 
their head. Truly, the gods do not eat or drink. They are 
satisfied by merely looking at the nectar. 

2 

They retire into that dark colour and rise up from that colour. 
3 

He who thus knows this nectar becomes one of the Adityas, 
with Varuna at their head; he is satisfied by merely looking at 
the nectar. He returns into that dark colour and again rises up 
from that colour. 


4 


As long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice 
as long does it rise in the west and set in the east and just so 
long does he, like the Adityas, enjoy rulership and sovereignty. 


 


Chapter IX — Meditation on the Maruts 
1 


On the fourth of these nectars the Maruts live, with Soma at 
their head. Truly, the gods do not eat or drink. They are 
satisfied by merely looking at the nectar. 


2 


They retire into that extremely dark colour and rise up from 
that colour. 


3 


He who thus knows this nectar becomes one of the Maruts, 
with Soma at their head; he is satisfied by merely looking at the 
nectar. He retires into that extremely dark colour and again 
rises up from that colour. 


4 


As long as the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, twice as 
long does it rise in the north and set in the south and just so 
long does he, like the Maruts, enjoy rulership and sovereignty. 


Chapter X — Meditation on the Sadhyas 

1 

On the fifth of these nectars the Sadhyas live, with Brahma at 
their head. Truly, the gods do not eat or drink. They are 
satisfied by merely looking at the nectar. 

2 

Thy retire into that form and rise up from that form. 

3 

He who knows this nectar becomes one of the Sadhyas, with 
Brahma at their head; he is satisfied by merely looking at the 
nectar. He retires into that form and again rises up from that 
form. 

4 

As long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, twice 


as long does it rise above and set below and just so long does 
he, like the Sadhyas, enjoy rulership and sovereignty. 


 


Chapter XI — The Result of the Meditation on the Honey 
1 

Now, after having risen thence upwards, it (i.e. the sun) rises 
and sets no more. It remains alone in the centre. And on this 
there is the following verse: 


2 


"There (i.e. in Brahmaloka) the sun neither rises nor sets at any 
time. O ye gods, if this is true, may I never fall from Brahman!" 


3 


Verily, for him who thus knows this Brahma—Upanishad, the 
sun does not rise or set. For him it is day for ever. 


4 

This doctrine Brahma told to Prajapati, Prajapati to Manu, 
Manu to his offspring. And to Uddalaka Aruni this doctrine of 
Brahman was narrated by his father. 


5 


A father may therefore tell that doctrine of Brahman to his 
eldest son to a worthy disciple. 


6 

It must not be told to anyone else, even if he should offer one 
the whole sea—girt earth, full of treasure; for this doctrine is 
worth more an that, yea, it is worth more. 

Chapter XII — Meditation on the Gayatri 

1 

The gayatri is everything, whatever here exists. Speech is verily 
the Gayatri, for speech sings forth (gaya—ti) and protects 
(traya—te) everything, whatever here exists. 


2 


That Gayatri is also the earth; for everything that exists here 
rests on this earth and does not go beyond. 


 


3 


In man, that Gayatri is also the body; for the pranas exist in this 
body and do not go beyond. 


4 


That body, in man, is again the heart within a man; for the 
pranas exist in it and do not go beyond. 


5 


That Gayatri has four feet and is sixfold. The same is also 
declared by a Rik—verse: 


6 


"Such is its greatness (i.e. of Brahman as known through the 
symbol of the Gayatri). Greater than it is the Person (Brahman). 
One of Its feet covers all beings; the immortal three feet are in 
heaven (i.e. in Itself) 


7—9 


The Brahman which has been thus described is the same as the 
physical akasa outside a person. The akasa which is outside a 
person is the same as that which is inside a person. The akasa 
which is inside a person is the akasa within the heart. The akasa 
which is within the heart is omnipresent and unchanging. He 
who knows this obtains full and unchanging prosperity. 


Chapter XIII — Meditation on the Door—Keepers 
1 


Of that heart there are five doors controlled by the devas. That 
which is the eastern door is the prana—that is the eye, that is 
Aditya (the sun). One should meditate on that as brightness and 
the source of food. He who knows this becomes bright and an 
eater of food. 


2 


That which is the southern gate is the vyana—that is the ear, 
that is Chandrama (the moon). One should meditate on that as 
prosperity and fame. He who knows this becomes prosperous 
and famous. 


 


3 


That which is the western gate is the apana—that is speech, that 
is Agni (fire). One should meditate on that as the radiance of 
Brahman and the source of food. He who knows this becomes 
radiant and an eater of food. 


4 


That which is the northern gate is the samana—that is the mind, 
that is Parjanya (the rain—god). One should meditate on that as 
fame and beauty. He who knows this becomes famous and 
beautiful. 


5 


That which is the upper gate is the udana—that is Vayu, that is 
the akasa. One should meditate on that as strength and 
greatness. He who knows this becomes strong and great. 


6 


These are the five servants of Brahman, the door—keepers of 
the world of heaven. He who thus knows these five servants of 
Brahman, the door—keepers of the world of heaven—in his 
family a hero is born. He who thus knows the five servants of 
Brahman, the door—keepers of the world of heaven, himself 
attains the world of heaven. 


7—8 


Now, the light which shines above this heaven, above all the 
worlds, above everything, in the highest worlds not excelled by 
any other worlds, that is the same light which is within man. 
There is this visible of this light: when we thus perceive by 
touch the warmth in the body. And of it we have this audible 
proof: when we thus hear, by covering the ears, what is like the 
rumbling of a carriage, or the bellowing of an ox, or the sound 
of a blazing fire. One should worship as Brahman that inner 
light which is seen and heard. He who knows becomes 
conspicuous and celebrated, yea, he becomes celebrated. 


Chapter XIV — The Sandilya Doctrine 

1 

All this is Brahman. From It the universe comes forth, in It the 
universe merges and in It the universe breathes. Therefore a 


man should meditate on Brahman with a calm mind. 
Now, verily, a man consists of will. As he wills in this world, 


 


so does he become when he has departed hence. Let him with 
this knowledge in mind form his will. 


2—3 


He who consists of the mind, whose body is subtle, whose form 
is light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature is like the akasa, 
whose creation in this universe, who cherishes all righteous 
desires, who contains all pleasant odours, who is endowed with 
all tastes, who embraces all this, who never speaks and who is 
without longing— 

He is my Self within the heart, smaller than a grain of rice, 
smaller than a grain of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, 
smaller than a grain of millet; He is my Self within the heart, 
greater than the earth, greater than the mid—region, greater 
than heaven, greater than all these worlds. 


4 


He whose creation is this universe, who cherishes all desires, 
who contains all odours, who is endowed with all tastes, who 
embraces all this, who never speaks and who is without 
longing—He is my Self within the heart, He is that Brahman. 
When I shall have departed hence I shall certainly reach Him: 
one who has this faith and has no doubt will certainly attain to 
that Godhead. Thus said Sandilya, yea, thus he said. 


Chapter XV — Meditation on the Universe as a Chest 
1 


The chest of the universe, with the mid—region for its inside 
and the earth for its bottom, does not decay. The quarters are its 
different corners and heaven is its lid, which is above. This 
chest is the storehouse of treasures. Inside it are all things. 


2 


The eastern quarter is called Juhu, the southern quarter 
Sahamana, the western quarter Rajni and the northern quarter 
Subhuta. Vayu the air is their child. He who knows this Vayu 
as the child of the quarters never weeps for his sons. 

I know the air to be the child of the quarters; may I never weep 
for my sons. 


3 
I take refuge in the imperishable chest with this one and this 


one and this one. I take refuge in the prana with this one and 
this one and this one. I take refuge in Bhuh with this one and 


 


this one and this one. I take refuge in Bhuvah with this one and 
this one and this one. I take refuge Svah with this one and this 
one and this one. 


4 


When I said: "I take refuge in the prana," prana meant 
everything that exists here—in that I take refuge. 


5 


When I said: "I take refuge in Bhuh," what I really said was: "I 
refuge in the earth, the mid—region and heaven." 


6 


Then I said: "I take refuge in Bhuvah," what I said was: "I take 
in fire, the air and the sun." 


'j 


When I said: "I take refuge in Svah," what I said was: "I take 
refuge in the Rig—Veda, Yajur—Veda and Sama—Veda." 
That is what I said, yea, that is what I said. 


Chapter XVI — Man as a Sacrifice (I) 
1 


A person, indeed, is a sacrifice. His first twenty—four years 
constitute the morning libation. The Gayatri metre has 
twenty—four syllables and the morning libation is offered with 
Gayatri hymns. The Vasus are connected with that part of the 
sacrifice. The pranas are the Vasus; for, verily, they make 
everything abide (visayanti) in this body. 


2 


If anything ails him during that period, he should recite the 
following mantra: "O ye pranas, ye Vasus, unite this morning 
libation with the midday libation. May I, who am a sacrifice, 
not disappear in the midst of the pranas, who are the Vasus." 
Thus he rises from his illness and becomes free of it. 


3 
His next forty—four years constitute the midday libation. The 


Tristubh metre has forty—four syllables and the midday 
libation is offered with Tristubh hymns. The Rudras are 


 


connected with that part of the sacrifice. The pranas are the 
Rudras; for, verily, they make everything weep (rodayanti). 


4 


If anything ails him during that second period, he should recite 
the following mantra: "O ye pranas, ye Rudras, unite this 
midday libation with the third libation. May I, who am a 
sacrifice, not disappear in the midst of the pranas, who are the 
Rudras." Thus he rises from his illness and becomes free of it. 


5 


His next forty—eight years constitute the third oblation. The 
Jagati metre has forty—eight syllables and the third oblation is 
offered with Jagati hymns. The Adityas are connected with that 
part of the sacrifice. The pranas are the Adityas; for, verily, 
they take up (adadate) every—thing. 


6 


If anything ails him during that third period, he should recite 
the following mantra: "O ye pranas, ye Adityas, extend this my 
third libation to the full age. May I, who am a sacrifice, not 
disappear in the midst of the pranas, who are the Adityas." 
Thus he rises from his illness and becomes free of it. 


7 

Mahidasa, the son of Itara, knew this and said addressing a 
disease: "O you disease! Why do you afflict me? I shall not die 
of this pain" He lived a hundred and sixteen years. He, too, who 
knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years. 

Chapter X VII — Man as a Sacrifice (IID 

i 


When a man hungers, thirsts and abstains from pleasures— 
these are his initiatory rites. 


2 


When he eats, drinks and enjoys pleasures, he then participates 
in Upasadas. 


3 


When a man laughs, eats and enjoys sexual intercourse—these 
are Stuta and Sastra. 


 


4 


Austerity, almsgiving, uprightness, non—violence and 
truthfulness—these are the gifts (dakshina) for the priests. 


5 


Because the life of a man is a sacrifice therefore they say that 
his mother will give birth (soshyati) to him, or his mother has 
given birth (asoshta) to him. The same words are used in the 
Soma—sacrifice and mean: "He will pour out the Soma— 
juice" and "He has poured out the Soma—juice." This is his 
birth. His death is the Avabhritha. 


6 


Ghora, of the line of Angirasa, communicated this teaching to 
Krishna, the son of Devaki—and it quenched Krishna's thirst 
for any other knowledge—and said: "When a man approaches 
death he should take refuge in these three thoughts: "Thou art 
indestructible (akshata),' "Thou art unchanging (aprachyuta),' 
and "Thou art the subtle prana.' 

"On this subject there are two Rik—verses: 


7 


"They (i.e. the knowers of Brahman) see everywhere the 
Supreme Light, which shines in Brahman, which is all— 
pervading like the light of day and which belongs to the 
primeval Seed. 

'Perceiving the higher light in the sun—which is above the 
darkness of ignorance—as the higher light in the heart, 
perceiving the Supreme Light which is higher than all lights, 
we have reached the Highest Light, the Sun, the most luminous 
among the gods, yea, we have reached the Highest Light, the 
Sun, the most luminous among the gods." 


Chapter XVIII — The Mind and the Akasa as Symbols of 
Brahman 


1 


One should meditate on the mind as Brahman—this is said with 
reference to the body. One should meditate on the akasa as 
Brahman—this is to said with reference to the gods. Thus 
both—the meditation with reference to the body and the 
meditation with reference to the gods—are being taught. 


 


2 


That Brahman has four feet (quarters): speech is one foot, the 
prana (the nose) is one foot, the eye is one foot, the ear is one 
foot—this is to said with reference to the body. Now with 
reference to the gods: Agni (fire) is one foot, Vayu (air) is one 
foot, Aditya (the sun) is one foot and the quarters (disah) are 
one foot. This is the twofold meditation with reference to the 
body and with reference to the gods. 


3 


Speech is, indeed, a fourth foot (quarter) of Brahman of which 
the mind is a symbol. It shines and warms with the light of fire. 
He who knows this shines and warms with fame, with renown 
and with the radiance of Brahman. 


4 


Prana (the nose) is, indeed, a fourth foot of Brahman. It shines 
and warms with the light of the air. He who knows this shines 
and warms with fame, with renown and with the radiance of 
Brahman. 


5 


The eye, indeed, is a fourth foot of Brahman. It shines and 
warms with the light of the sun. He who knows this shines and 
warms with fame, with renown and with the radiance of 
Brahman. 


6 


The ear, indeed, is a fourth foot of Brahman. It shines and 
warms with the light of the quarters. With fame, with renown 
and with the radiance of Brahman he shines and warms who 
knows this, yea, who knows this. 


Chapter XIX — Meditation on the Sun as Brahman 
1 


The sun is Brahman: this is the teaching. An explanation 
thereof follows: 

In the beginning this universe was non—existent. It became 
existent. It grew. It turned into an egg. The egg lay for the 
period of a year. Then it broke open. Of the two halves of the 
ege—shell, one half was of silver, the other of gold. 


 


2 


That which was of silver became the earth; that which was of 
gold, heaven. What was the thick membrane of the white 
became the mountains; the thin membrane of the yolk, the must 
and the clouds. The veins became the rivers; the fluid in the 
bladder, the ocean. 


3 


And what was born of it was yonder Aditya, the sun. when it 
was born shouts of "Hurrah!" arose, together with all beings 
and all objects of desire. Therefore at its rise and its every 
return shouts of "Hurrah!" together with all beings and all 
objects of desire arise. 


4 


He who, knowing this, meditates on the sun as Brahman— 
pleasant sounds will quickly approach him and continue to 
delight him, yea, continue to delight him. 


Part Four 
Chapter I — The Story of Janasruti and Raikva 
1 


There once lived a king named Janasruti, who was a great— 
grandson of Janasruta. He bestowed his gifts with respect, gave 
away liberally and cooked much food for the hungry. He built 
rest—houses every—where with the thought that people 
everywhere would eat his food.

One night some flamingos were flying along. One flamingo 
said to another: "Hey! Ho! Short—sighted, Short—sighted! 
The radiance of Janasruti, the great—grandson of Janasruta, has 
spread to the sky. Do not touch it, lest it should burn you." 


3 
The other replied: "Say, who is this person about whom you 
have spoken as though he were like Raikva, the man with the 


cart?" 
"What sort of person is this Raikva, the man with the cart?" 


 


4 


The short—sighted flamingo replied: "As in a game of dice, 
when the krita is won, the lower ones also are won, so whatever 
merits people acquire all accrue to that Raikva. As Raikva I 
describe him, too, who knows what Raikva knows." 


5—6 


Janasruti the great—grandson of Janasruta overheard this 
conversation. Immediately after getting out of bed, he said to 
his attendant: 

"Friend, did you speak of me as though I were Raikva, the man 
with the cart?" 

"What sort of person is Raikva, the man with the cart?" 

"As in a game of dice, when the krita is won, the lower ones 
also are won, so whatever merits people acquire all accrue to 
that Raikva. As Raikva I describe him, too, who knows what 
Raikva knows." 


7 


The attendant searched for him and returned without finding 
him. Then the king said to him: "Listen, where a knower of 
Brahman is to searched for, look for him there." 


8 


After proper search the attendant came upon a person who, 
lying underneath his cart, was scratching an itch. Humbly he 
took his seat near him and said: "Revered Sir, are you Raikva, 
the man with the cart?" 

"Oh yes, I am he," he answered. 

Then the attendant returned, saying to himself: "I have found 
him out." 


Chapter II — Dialogue of Raikva and Janasruti (I) 
1—2 


Then Janasruti the great—grandson of Janasruta took with him 
six hundred cows, a necklace and a chariot with mules and 
went to Raikva and said: 

"Raikva, here are six hundred cows, a necklace and a chariot 
with mules. Pray, revered Sir, teach me the deity whom you 
worship." 


 


3 


To him the other said: "Ah, may the necklace and the chariot 
remain with you, O Sudra, along with the cows." 

Thereupon Janasruti the great—grandson of Janasruta took 
with him a thousand cows, a chariot with mules, a necklace and 
his own daughter, too and went to Raikva. 


4 


Janasruti said to him: "Raikva, here are a thousand cows, a 
necklace, a chariot with mules, this wife and this village where 
you shall dwell. Revered Sir, teach me." 


5 


Then considering her (the princess) as the door for imparting 
knowledge, Raikva said: "O Sudra! You brought these cows 
and other presents; this is good. But you will make me speak 
now only through this means (i.e. the princess)." 

These are the villages named Raikvaparna, in the country of 
Mahavrishas, where Raikva lived. 

Now Raikva said to the king: 


Chapter II — Dialogue of Raikva and Janasruti (II) 

1 

"Verily, Vayu (the air) is the swallower (samvarga). For when 
fire goes out it is indeed swallowed by the air. When the sun 
sets it is swallowed by the air. When the moon sets it is 
swallowed by the air. 


2 


"When water dries up it is swallowed by the air. For indeed the 
air absorbs them all. So much with reference to the gods. 


3 

"Now with reference to the body: Verily, the prana is the 
swallower. When a man sleeps, speech goes into the prana, 
sight goes into the prana, hearing goes into the prana and the 
mind goes into the prana. For indeed the prana absorbs them 
all. 

4 


"These are the two swallowers: the air among the gods, the 
prana among the senses." 


 


5 


Once Saunaka of the line of Kapi and Abhipratarin, the son of 
Kakshasena, were being waited upon at their meal, when a 
brahmacharin begged food of them. They did not give him 
anything. 


6 


He said: "One God, Prajapati, swallowed the four great ones. 
He is the Guardian of the world. O descendent of Kapi, O 
Abhipratarin, mortals do not see Him though he abides in 
manifold forms. Verily, this food has not been given to Him to 
whom it belongs." 


7 


Sanaka of the line of Kapi, pondering on those words, went to 
the brahmacharin and said: "He is the self of the gods, the 
creator of all beings, with unbroken teeth, the eater, the truly 
wise one. They speak of His magnificence as great, because 
without being eaten, He eats even what is not common food. O 
brahmacharin, we meditate upon this Brahman." 

Then he said to the attendants: "Give him food." 


8 


They gave food to him. Now these five (i.e. the eater vayu and 
fire, the sun, the moon and water, which are its food) and those 
five (i.e. the eater prana and the organs of speech, the eye, the 
ear and the mind, which are its food) make ten. These together 
constitute the krita (the highest throw in a game of dice). On 
account of this similarity of ten, these ten are the food in the ten 
quarters and further, they are Virat, the eater of food, by which 
all this becomes seen. All this he sees and the eater of food he 
becomes, who knows this, yea, who knows this. 


Chapter IV — The Story of Satyakama 

1 

Once upon a time, Satyakama the son of Jabala addressed his 
mother and said: "Revered Mother, I wish to become a 
brahmacharin. Of what ancestry am I?" 

2 

She said to him: "I do not know, my child, of what ancestry you 


are. In my youth I was preoccupied with many household 
duties and with attending on guests when I conceived you. I do 


 


not know of what ancestry you are. I am Jabala by name and 
you are Satyakama. So you may speak of yourself as 
Satyakama Jabala (the son of Jabala). 

He came to Gautama the son of Haridrumata and said: 
"Revered Sir, I wish to live with you as a brahmacharin. May I 
approach you, as a pupil?" 


4 


Gautama said to him: "Of what ancestry are you, dear friend?" 
Satyakama said: "I do not know, Sir, of what ancestry I am. I 
asked my mother about it and she replied: 'In my youth I was 
preoccupied with many household duties and with attending on 
guests when I conceived you. I do not know of what ancestry 
you are. I am Jabala by name and you are Satyakama.' I am 
therefore, Sir, Satyakama Jabala." 


5 


Gautama said: "None but a true brahmin would thus speak out. 
Fetch the fuel, dear friend; I shall initiate you. You have not 
departed from truth." 

He initiated Satyakama. Having separated out four hundred 
lean and weak cows from his herd, he said: "Dear friend, go 
with these." 

Driving them away toward the forest, Satyakama said: "I shall 
not return until they become a thousand." He lived a number of 
years in the forest. 

When the cows had become a thousand— 


Chapter V — Instruction by the Bull 
i 


The bull of the herd, addressing him, said: "Satyakama!" 
"Revered Sir!" Satyakama replied. 

The bull said: "Dear friend, we have become a thousand, take 
us to teacher's house. 


2 


"I will declare to you one foot of Brahman." 

"Declare it, Revered Sir." 

The bull said to him: "The east is one quarter, the west is one 
quarter, the south is one quarter, the north is one quarter. This, 
dear friend, is foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters and 
this foot is called Prakasavat (shining). 


 


3 


"He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman 
consisting four quarters as shining, becomes shining on this 
earth. He conquers shining worlds—he who knows this and 
meditates on the foot of Brahman consisting of four quarters as 
shining." 


Chapter VII — Instruction by Fire 
1 


The bull further said: "Agni (fire) will declare to you another 
foot of Brahman." 

Satyakama then, when it was the morrow, drove the cows in the 
direction of the teacher's house. And when they came together 
toward evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid fuel on 
the fire and sat down behind the fire, facing the east. 


2 


Agni (fire), addressing him, said: "Satyakama!" 
"Revered Sir!" Satyakama replied. 


3 


"Dear friend, I will declare to you one foot of Brahman." 
"Declare it, revered Sir." 

Agni said to him: "The earth is one quarter, the sky is one 
quarter, heaven is one quarter, the ocean is one quarter. This, 
dear friend, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters 
and this foot is called Anantavat (endless). 


4 


"He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman 
consisting of four quarters as endless, becomes endless on this 
earth. He conquers endless worlds—he who knows this and 
meditates on the foot of Brahman consisting of four quarters as 
endless." 


Chapter VII — Instruction by the Swan 

1 

Agni further said: "A hamsa (swan) will declare to you another 
foot." 


Satyakama then, when it was the morrow, drove the cows in the 
direction of the teacher's house. And when they came together 


 


toward evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid fuel on 
the fire and sat down behind the fire, facing the east. 


2 


Then a swan flew to him and said: "Satyakama!" 
"Revered Sir!" Satyakama replied. 


a 


Dear friend, I will declare to you one foot of Brahman." 
"Declare it, revered Sir." 

The swan said to him: "Fire is one quarter, the sun is one 
quarter, the moon is one quarter, lightning is one quarter. This, 
dear friend, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters 
and this foot is called Jyotishmat (luminous). 


4 


He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman 
consisting of four quarters as luminous, becomes luminous on 
this earth. He conquers luminous worlds—he who knows this 
and meditates on the foot of Brahman consisting of four 
quarters as luminous. 


Chapter VIII — Instruction by the Diver—Bird 
1 


The swan further said: "A madgu (diver—bird) will declare to 
you another foot." 

Satyakama then, when it was the morrow, drove the cows in the 
direction of the teacher's house. And when they came together 
toward evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid fuel on 
the fire and sat down behind the fire, facing the east. 


2 


Then a diver—bird flew to him and said: "Satyakama!" 
"Revered Sir!" Satyakama replied. 


3 


"Dear friend, I will declare to you one foot of Brahman." 
"Declare it, revered Sir." 

The diver—bird said to him: "The prana is one quarter, the eye 
is One quarter, the ear is one quarter, the mind is one quarter. 
This, dear friend, is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four 
quarters and this foot is called Ayatanavat (having support). 


 


4 


"He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman 
consisting of four quarters as Ayatanavat, possesses a support 
(i.e. home) on this earth. He conquers the worlds which offer a 
home—he who knows this and meditates on the foot of 
Brahman consisting of four quarters as Ayatanavat." 


Chapter IX — Instruction by the Teacher  


Satyakama reached the teacher's house. The teacher said to 
him: "Satyakama!" 
"Revered Sir!" Satyakama replied. 


2 


The teacher said: "Dear friend, you shine like one who knows 
Brahman. Who has taught you?" 

"Others than men," he replied. "But I wish, revered Sir, that 
you alone should teach me." 


3 


"For I have heard from persons like your good self that only 
knowledge which is learnt from a teacher (acharya) leads to the 
highest good." 

Then he (Gautama) taught him the same knowledge. Nothing 
whatsoever was left out, yea, nothing whatsoever was left out. 


Chapter X — The Story of Upakosala 
1 


Upakosala the son of Kamala dwelt as a brahmachirin 
(religious student) with Satyakama the son of Jabala. He tended 
his teacher's fires for twelve years. Satyakama allowed his 
other pupils to return to their homes after they had finished 
their Vedic studies but did not allow Upakosala to depart. 


2 
Then his wife said to him: "This brahmachirin, practising 
austerities, has intelligently tended your fires. Give him 


instruction lest the fires should blame you." The teacher, 
however, went away on a journey without teaching him. 


 


3 


The brahmachirin out of mental grief began to fast. Then the 
teacher's wife said to him: "Brahmachirin, why do you not 
eat?" 

He said: "There are in a man like me many desires directed to 
various objects. I am full of sorrows. I will not eat." 


4 


Thereupon the fires said among themselves: "This 
brahmachirin, practising austerities, has intelligently tended us. 
Come, let us teach him." 

They said to him: "The prana is Brahman, ka (joy) is Brahman, 
kha (the akaha) is Brahman." 


5 


He said: "I understand that the prana is Brahman, but I do not 
understand 'joy' (ka) and 'the akasa' (kha)." 

They said: "What is joy (ka) is the akasa (kha), what is the 
akasa (kha) is joy (ka)." 

They taught him the prana (i.e. Brahman) and the akasa related 
to it. 


Chapter XI — Instruction by the Household Fire 
1 


Next the Garhapatya Fire taught him: "The earth, fire, food and 
the sun are my forms. The person that is seen in the sun—I am 
he, I am he indeed. 


2 


"He who, knowing this, meditates on the fire frees himself from 
sinful actions, obtains the World of the Garhapatya Fire, 
reaches his full age and lives brightly. His descendants do not 
perish. We support him in this world and in the other who, 
knowing this, meditates on the fire." 


Chapter XII — Instruction by the Southern Fire 
1 
Then the Anvaharya (Southern) Fie taught him: "Water, the 


quarters, the stars and the moon are my forms. The person that 
is seen in the moon—I am he, I am he indeed. 


 


2 


"He who, knowing this, meditates on the fire frees himself from 
sinful actions, obtains the World of the Anvaharya Fire, reaches 
his full age and lives brightly. His descendants do not perish. 
We support him in this world and in the other who, knowing 
this, meditates on the fire." 


Chapter XIII — Instruction by the Ahavaniya Fire 
1 


Then the Ahavaniya Fire taught him: "The prana, the akaha, 
heaven and lightning are my forms. The person that is seen in 
lightning—I am he, I am he indeed. 


2 


"He who, knowing this, meditates on the fire frees himself from 
sinful actions, obtains the World of the Anvaharya Fire, reaches 
his full age and lives brightly. His descendants do not perish. 
We support him in this world and in the other who, knowing 
this, meditates on the fire." 


Chapter XIV — Dialogue between the Teacher and the 
Pupil 


1 


Then they (i.e. all the fires) said: "Upakosala, dear friend, thus 
we taught you the knowledge of ourselves and the knowledge 
of the Self. But the teacher will teach you the way." 
The teacher returned and said to him: "Upakosala!" 


2—3 


He replied: "Revered Sir!" 

"Dear friend, your face shines like that of one who knows 
Brahman. Who has taught you?" 

"Who should teach me, Sir?" 

Here he conceals the fact, as it were. 

And he said pointing to the fires: "For this reason they are of 
this form now, though they were of a different form before." 
"Dear friend, what did they teach you?" 

"This," Upakosala replied and repeated some of what the fires 
had told him. 

The teacher said: "They told you, dear friend, only about the 
worlds, but I shall tell you about Brahman. As water does not 
cling to the lotus leaf, so no evil clings to one who knows this." 
Upakosala said to him: "Revered Sir, please tell me." 


 


Chapter XV — Instruction by the Teacher 
1 


He said: "The person that is seen in the eye—that is the Self. 
This is the immortal, the fearless; this is Brahman. That is why, 
if one drops melted butter or water in the eye, it flows away on 
both sides. 


2 


"The seers call him Samyadvama, for all blessings (vama) go 
towards him (samyanti). All blessings go towards him who 
knows this. 


3 


"He is also Vamani, for he carries to living beings (nayati) all 
blessings (vama). He who knows this carries all blessings. 


4 


"He is also called Bhamani, for he shines (bhati) in all the 
worlds. He who knows this shines in all the worlds. 


5 


"Now, whether or not they perform the funeral rites for such a 
person, he goes to light, from light to day, from day to the 
bright half of the moon, from the bright half of the moon to the 
six months during which the sun goes to the north, from those 
months to the year, from the year to the sun, from the sun to the 
moon, from the moon to lightning. There a person who is not a 
human being meets him and leads him to Brahman. This is the 
Path of the Gods (Devayana), the path leading to Brahman. 
Those who travel by it do not return to the whirl of humanity, 
yea, they do not return." 


Chapter X VI — The Silence of the Brahma Priest 

1 

Verily, he who moves along (i.e. the air) is the sacrifice; for he, 
moving along, purifies everything. And because, moving along, 


he purifies everything, he is the sacrifice. Of that sacrifice, the 
mind and speech are the two ways. 


 


2—3 


The Brahma priest purifies one of the two (i.e. the mind) by his 
mind. The other (i.e. speech) is purified through words by the 
hotri priest, the adhvaryu priest and the udgatri priest. 

If the Brahma priest, after the Prataranuvaka hymn has begun 
and before the recitation of the Paridhaniya hymn, breaks his 
silence and speaks, he purifies only one of the ways (i.e. 
speech), but the other (i.e. the mind) is injured. As a man 
walking on one leg, or a carriage going on one wheel, is 
injured, likewise the sacrifice is injured. Following the injury to 
the sacrifice, the sacrificer too is injured. By performing the 
defective sacrifice he becomes more sinful. 


4 


But if the Brahma priest, after the Prataranuvaka hymn has 
begun and before the recitation of the Paridhaniya, does not 
break his silence and speak, he purifies both the ways and 
neither of them is injured. 

As a man walking on two legs or a carriage going on two 
wheels goes on without obstacle, likewise the sacrifice goes on 
without obstacle. Following the success of the sacrifice, the 
sacrificer too fares well. Having performed the sacrifice he 
becomes better. 


Chapter X VII — Penances for Mistakes in the Sacrifice 
1 


Prajapati brooded over the worlds; from them, thus brooded 
over, he squeezed the essences: agni (fire) from the earth, vayu 
(air) from the mid—region and aditya (the sun) from heaven. 


2 


He brooded over these three deities; from them, thus brooded 
over, he squeezed the essences. The Rik—verses from fire, the 
Yajus—verses from the air and the Saman—verses from the 
sun. 


3 


He brooded over the threefold knowledge (i.e. the three Vedas); 
from them, thus brooded over, he squeezed the essences: Bhuh 
from the Rik—verses, Bhuvah from the Yajus—verses and 
Svah from the Saman—verses. 


 


4 


If the sacrifice is injured with regard to the Rik—verses, one 
should then offer a libation in the Garhapatya Fire saying: 
"Bhuh Svaha!" Thus is healed the injury with regard to the 
Rik—verses by means of the essence and the power of the 
Rik—verses themselves. 


5 


If the sacrifice is injured with regard to the Yajus—verses, one 
should then offer a libation in the Southern (Dakshina) Fire, 
saying: "Bhuvah Svaha!" Thus is healed the injury with regard 
to the Yajus—verses by means of the essence and the power of 
the Yajus—verses themselves. 


6 


If the sacrifice is injured with regard to the Saman—verses, one 
should then offer a libation in the Ahavaniya Fire, saying: 
"Svah Svaha!" Thus is healed the injury with regard to the 
Saman—verses by means of the essence and the power of the 
Saman—verses themselves. 


7—8 


As one binds gold by means of borax and silver by means of 
gold and tin by means of silver and lead by means of tin and 
iron by means of lead and wood by means of iron or leather, 
Likewise one heals any injury done to the sacrifice with the 
power of these worlds, these gods and these three Vedas. That 
sacrifice is well healed in which there is a Brahma priest who 
knows this. 


9—10 


That sacrifice is inclined to the north in which there is a 
Brahma priest who knows this. And with regard to such a 
Brahma priest, there is the following gatha: "Wherever it is 
injured, thither he (the Brahma priest) goes." 

The silent Brahma alone, as one or the priests, protects the 
sacrificer, as a mare protects a warrior. Because the Brahma 
priest who knows this protects the sacrifice, the sacrificer and 
all the priests, one should therefore make a person who knows 
this the Brahma priest and not one who knows it not, yea, not 
one who knows it not. 


 


Part Five 
Chapter I — The Supremacy of the Prana 
1 


Om. He who knows what is the oldest and greatest becomes 
himself the oldest and greatest. The prana, indeed, is the oldest 
and greatest. 


2 


He who knows what is the most excellent (vasishtha) becomes 
the most excellent among his kinsmen. The organ of speech, 
indeed, is the most excellent. 


3 


He who knows what has the attributes of firmness (pratishtha) 
becomes firm in this world and the next. The eye, indeed, is 
endowed with firmness. 


4 


He who knows prosperity (sampad), his wishes are fulfilled— 
both divine and human wishes. The ear, indeed, is prosperity. 


5 


He who knows the abode (ayatana) becomes the abode of his 
kinsmen. The mind, indeed, is the abode. 


6 


The pranas (sense—organs) disputed among themselves about 
who was the best among them, each saying: "I am the best," "I 
am the best." 


7 


They went to Prajapati, their progenitor and said: "O revered 
Sir, who is the best among us?" 

He said to them: "He by whose departure the body looks worse 
than the worst is the best among you." 


8 
The organ of speech departed. After being away for a whole 


year, it came back and said: "How have you been able to live 
without me?" The other organs replied: "We lived just as dumb 
people live, without speaking, but breathing with the prana 
(nose), seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear and thinking 
with the mind." Then the organ of speech entered the body. 


9 


The eye departed. After being away for a whole year, it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 
The other organs replied: "We lived just as blind people live, 
without seeing, but breathing with the prana, speaking with the 
tongue, hearing with the ear and thinking with the mind." Then 
the eye entered the body. 


10 


The ear went out. After being away for a whole year, it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 
The other organs replied: "We lived just as deaf people live, 
without hearing, but breathing with the prana. Speaking with 
the tongue, seeing with the eye and thinking with the mind." 
Then the ear entered the body. 


it 


The mind went out. After being away for a whole year, it came 
back and said: "How have you been able to live without me?" 
The other organs replied: "We lived just like children whose 
minds are not yet formed, without thinking with the mind, but 
breathing with the prana, speaking with the tongue, seeing with 
the eye and hearing with the ear." Then the mind entered the 
body. 


12 


Then as the vital breath was about to depart, he uprooted the 
organs from their places just as a noble horse tears up the pegs 
to which its feet are tied. They came to him and said: "Revered 
Sir, be thou our lord; thou art the best among us. Do not depart 
from us." 


13 
Then the organ of speech said to him: "That attribute of being 
most excellent which I possess is thine." 


Then the eye said: "That attribute of firmness which I possess is 
thine." 


 


14 


Then the ear said: "That attribute of prosperity which I possess 
is thine." 

Then the mind said: "That attribute of being the abode which I 
possess is thine." 


15 


And people do not call them (1.e. the sense—organs) the organs 
of speech, the eyes, the ears, or the mind, but the pranas. The 
prana alone is all these. 


Chapter II — The Mantha Rite 
I 


The prana said: "What will be my food?" 

They answered: "Whatever food there is—including that of 
dogs and birds." 

The Upanishad says: All that is eaten is the food of the ana. 
Ana is his (i.e. the prana's) direct name. For one who knows 
this, there exists nothing which is not food. 


2 


He said: "What will be my dress?" 

They answered: "Water." Therefore when people eat they cover 
him (the prana), both before and after eating, with water. Thus 
the prana obtains clothing and is no longer naked. 


3 


Satyakama the son of Jabala explained this doctrine of the 
prana to Gosruti, the son of Vyaghrapada and said: "If one 
should tell this to a dry stump, branches would grow and leaves 
spring forth." 


4 


Now, if a man wishes to attain greatness, he should perform the 
initiatory rite on the day of the new moon and then on the night 
of the full moon he should stir a paste of all the herbs with 
curds and honey and offer it as a libation in the fire where the 
melted butter is offered, saying: "Svaha to the oldest (jyashtha) 
and greatest (sreshtha)!" Then let him throw the remainder 
adhering to the ladle into the paste. 


 


5 


In the same manner he should offer a libation in the fire where 
the melted butter is offered, saying: "Svaha to the most 
excellent (vasishtha)!" Then let him throw the remainder 
adhering to the ladle into the paste. 

In the same manner he should offer a libation into the fire 
where the melted butter is offered, saying: "Svaha to firmness 
(pratishthi)!" and then throw the remainder adhering to the 
ladle into the paste. 

In the same manner he should offer a libation in the fire where 
the melted butter is offered, saying: "Svaha to prosperity 
(sampad)!" and then throw the remainder adhering to the ladle 
into the paste. 

In the same manner he should offer a libation into the fire 
where the melted butter is offered, saying: "Svaha to the abode 
(ayatana)!" and then throw the remainder adhering to the ladle 
into the paste. 


6 


Then, moving away a little from the fire and holding the paste 
(mantha) in his hands, he recites: "Thou (prana) art ama by 
name, for all this rests in thee. He (i.e. the paste, which is the 
same as the prana) is the oldest, the greatest, the king and the 
sovereign. May he make me the oldest, the greatest, the king 
and the sovereign. May I be all this!" 


7 


Then he recites the following Rik—mantra, swallowing the 
paste (mantha) each time he utters a foot of the mantra: "We 
desire, of the great progenitor (i.e. the sun)"—here he swallows 
a little—"of the luminous, the food"—here he swallows a 
little— "the best and all—supporting"—here he swallows a 
little—"we meditate quickly on the nature of the sun"—here he 
swallows the whole. Having cleansed the vessel made of metal 
or wood, he lies down behind the fire, on a skin or on the bare 
ground, controlling his speech and self—possessed. If he sees a 
woman in a dream, then let him know that his work (rite) has 
been a success. 


8 
On this there is the following verse: "If during rites performed 
with a view to fulfilling certain desires, he sees a woman in his 


dream, let him know of his success from this vision in a dream, 
yea, from this vision in a dream." 


 


Chapter III — The Story of Svetaketu and Pravahana 
1 


Svetaketu the grandson of Aruna came to the assembly of the 
Panchalas. Pravahana the son of Jibala said to him: "Boy, has 
your father instructed you?" 

"Yes, revered Sir," he replied. 


2 


The king said: "Do you know to what place men go after 
departing from here?" 

"No, revered Sir." 

"Do you know how they return again?" 

"No, revered Sir." 

"Do you know where the paths leading to the gods and leading 
to the Manes separate?" 

"No, revered Sir." 


a 


"Do you know why yonder world is not filled up?" 

"No, revered Sir." 

"Do you know how water, in the fifth oblation, comes to be 
called man?" 

"No, revered Sir." 


4 


"Then why did you say that you had been instructed? How 
could he who did not know these things say that he had been 
instructed?" 

Then Svetaketu went back to his father with a sorrowful mind 
and said to him: "Revered Sir, you told me that you had 
instructed me, though you had not instructed me. 


5 


"That fellow of a Kshatriya asked me five questions and I could 
not answer one of them." 

The father said: "As you have stated these questions to me, let 
me assure you that I do not know even one of them. If I had 
known them, why should I not have told them to you?" 


6 
Then Gautama went to the king's place. When he arrived the 


king showed him proper respect. Next morning, when the king 
came to the assembly, Gautama, too, came there. 


 


The king said to him: "Gautama, Sir, ask of me a boon relating 
to human wealth." 

He replied: "May human wealth remain with you. Tell me that 
speech which you addressed to my boy." 

The king became sad. 


7 


The king commanded him: "Stay with me for a long time." 
Then he said to him: "As to what you have told me, O 
Gautama, this knowledge did not reach any brahmin before 
you. Thus it was to the kshatriya alone, among all the people, 
that the teaching of this knowledge belonged." 

Then he began to teach him: 


Chapter IV — The Five Fires (1) 

1 

"Yonder world is the sacrificial fire, O Gautama, the sun the 
fuel, the rays the smoke, daytime the flame, the moon the 
embers and the stars the sparks. 


2 


"In this fire the gods offer faith as libation. Out of that offering 
King Moon is born." 


Chapter V — The Five Fires (II) 

I 

"Parjanya (the god of rain), O Gautama, is the fire, the air the 
fuel, the cloud the smoke, lightning the flame, the thunderbolt 
the embers and thunderings the sparks. 


2 


"In this fire the gods offer King Moon as libation. Out of that 
offering rain is born." 


Chapter VI— The Five Fires (II) 
1 
"The earth, O Gautama, is the fire, the year the fuel, the akasa 


the smoke, the night the flame, the quarters the embers and the 
intermediate quarters the sparks. 


 


2 


"In this fire the gods offer rain as libation. Out of that offering 
food is born." 


Chapter VII— The Five Fires (IV) 
1 


O Gautama, is the fire, speech is the fuel, the prana the smoke, 
the tongue the flame, the eye the embers and the ear the sparks. 


2 


"In this fire the gods offer food as libation. Out of that offering 
semen produced." 


Chapter VIII — The Five Fires (V) 

1 

"Woman, O Gautama, is the fire, her sexual organ is the fuel, 
what invites is the smoke, the vulva is the flame, what is done 
inside is the embers, the pleasures are the sparks. 


2 


"In this fire the gods offer semen as libation. Out of that 
offering the foetus is formed." 


Chapter IX — Birth and Death 

1 

"Thus in the fifth libation water comes to be called man. The 
foetus enclosed in the membrane, having lain inside for ten or 
nine months, or more or less, is born. 

2 

"Having been born, he lives whatever the length of his life may 
be. When he is dead, they carry him to the fire of the funeral 
pyre whence he came, whence he arose." 

Chapter X — The Various Paths followed after Death 
1—2 

"Those who know this and those who, dwelling in the forest, 


practise faith and austerities go to light, from light to day, from 


 


day to the bright half of the moon, from the bright half of the 
moon to the six months during which the sun goes to the north, 
from those months to the year, from the year to the sun, from 
the sun to the moon, from the moon to lightning. There a 
person who is not a human being meets him and leads him to 
Brahman. This is the Path of the Gods (Devayana). 


3 


"But those who, living in the village, perform sacrifices, 
undertake works of public utility and give alms go to smoke, 
from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of the moon, 
from the dark half of the moon to the six months during which 
the sun goes to the south. But they do not reach the year. 


4 


"From those months they go to the World of the Manes, from 
the world of the Manes to the akasa, from the akasa to the 
moon. This is King Soma. They are the food of the gods. Them 
the gods eat. 


5—6 


"Having dwelt there in the lunar world till their good works are 
consumed, they return again the same way they came. They 
first reach the akasa and from the akasa the air. Having become 
air, they become smoke; having become smoke, they become 
mist; 

"Having become mist, they become cloud; having become 
cloud, they fall as rain—water. Then they are born as rice and 
barley, herbs and trees, sesamum and beans. Thence the exit is 
most difficult; for whoever capable of begetting children eats 
that food and injects semen, they become like unto him. 


aq 


"Those whose conduct here on earth has been good will quickly 
attain some good birth—birth as a brahmin, birth as a kshatriya, 
or birth as a vaisya. But those whose conduct here has been evil 
will quickly attain some evil birth—birth as a dog, birth as a 
pig, or birth as a chandala. 


8 


"Those who neither practise meditation nor perform rituals do 
not follow either of these ways. They become those 
insignificant creatures which are continually revolving and 
about which it may be said: "Live and die.' This is the third 
place. 


 


"Therefore that world never becomes full. Let a man despise 
this course. To this end there is the following verse: 


9 


"A man who steals the gold of a brahmin, he (i.e. a brahmin) 
who drinks liquor, he who dishonours his teacher's bed and he 
who kills a brahmin—these four fall, as also a fifth who 
associates with them.' " 


10 


"But he who knows these Five Fires is not stained by sin even 
though associating with them. He becomes pure and clean and 
obtains the world of the blessed—he who knows this, yea, he 
who knows this." 


Chapter XI — Concerning the Universal Self 
1 


Prachinasala the son of Upamanyu, Satyayajna the son of 
Pulusha, Indradyumna the grandson of Bhallavi, Jana the son of 
Sarkaraksha and Budila the son of Asvatarasva—great 
householders and great scriptural scholars—came together and 
discussed the question: 

"What is our self and what is Brahman?" 


2 


They solved the problem with the words: "Revered Sirs, 
Uddalaka the son of Aruna knows, at present, about the 
Vaisvanara Self. Let us go to him." 

They went to him. 


3 


He (Uddalaka) concluded: "These great householders and great 
scriptural scholars will question me. Perhaps I shall not be able 
to tell them everything. Therefore I shall direct them to another 
teacher." 


4 
He said to them: "Revered Sirs, King Asvapati the son of 
Kekaya knows, at present, about the Vaisvanara Self. Let us all 


go to him." 
They went to him. 


 


5—7 


When they arrived, the king ordered that proper respect should 
be paid to each of them. The next morning, after leaving bed, 
he said to them: 

"In my kingdom there is no thief, no miser, no wine—bibber, 
no man without a sacrificial fire, no ignorant person, no 
adulterer, much less adulteress. 

"Revered Sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice. I shall give to 
you as much wealth as I give to each priest. Please, revered 
Sirs, stay here." 

They said: "If a person comes to another with a purpose, he 
should tell the other only about that. At present, you know 
about the Vaisvanara Self. Please tell us about Him." 

He said to them: "I shall give you a reply tomorrow morning." 
Next morning they approached him with fuel in their hands. 
Without having performed any initiatory rites, the king said to 
them: 


Chapter XII — The Head of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


"O son of Upamanyu, whom do you meditate on as the Self?" 
"Heaven only, venerable King," he replied. 

"The Self you meditate on," said the king "is the Vaisvanara 
Self called the Good Light (Sutejas). Therefore one sees in your 
family the Suta libation as also the Prasuta libation and the 
Asuta libation and you eat food and see what is pleasing. 
Whoever thus meditates on the Vaisvanara Self eats food, sees 
what is pleasing and has in his family the glory of Brahman. 
That, however, is only the head of the Self. Surely your head 
would have fallen off if you had not come to me." 


Chapter XIII — The Eye of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


Then he said to Satyayajna the son of Pulusha: "O 
Prachinayogya, whom do you meditate on as the Self?" 

"The sun only, venerable King," he replied. 

"The Self you meditate on," said the king, "is the Vaisvanara 
Self called the Universal Form (Visvarupa). Therefore one sees 
in your family much and manifold wealth—there are ready the 
chariot and mules, female servants and gold necklaces—and 
you eat food and see what is pleasing. Whoever thus meditates 
on the Vaisvanara Self eats food, sees what is pleasing and has 
in his family the glory of Brahman. That, however, is only the 
eye of the Self. Surely you would have become blind if you had 
not come to me." 


 


Chapter XIV — The Prana of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


Then he said to Indradyumna the grandson of Bhallavi: "O 
Vaiyaghrapadya, whom do you meditate on as the Self?" 
"The air only, venerable King," he replied. 


"The Self you meditate on," said the king, "is the Vaisvanara 
Self of varied courses (Prithagvartma). Therefore gifts come to 
you in various ways, rows of chariots follow you in various 
ways and you eat food and see what is pleasing. Whoever thus 
meditates on the Vaisvanara Self eats food, sees what is 
pleasing and has in his family the glory of Brahman. That, 
however, is only the prana of the Self. Surely your prana would 
have left you if you had not come to me." 


Chapter XV — The Trunk of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


Then he said to Jana the son of Sarkaraksha: "Whom do you 
meditate on as the Self?" 

"The akasa only, venerable King," he replied. 

"The Self you meditate on," said the king, "is the Vaisvanara 
Self called Bahula (full). Therefore you are full of offspring 
and wealth and you eat food and see what is pleasing. Whoever 
thus meditates on the Vaisvanara Self eats food, sees what is 
pleasing and has in his family the glory of Brahman. That, 
however, is only the trunk of the Self. Surely your trunk would 
have been destroyed if you had not come to me." 


Chapter X VI — The Bladder of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


Then he said to Budila the son of Asvatarasva: "O 
Vaiyaghrapadya, whom do you meditate on as the Self?" 
"Water only, venerable King," he replied. 

"The Self you meditate on," said the king, "is the Vaisvanara 
Self called Rayi (wealth). Therefore you are wealthy and 
flourishing and you eat food and see what is pleasing. Whoever 
thus meditates on the Vaisvanara Self eats food, sees what is 
pleasing and has in his family the glory of Brahman. That, 
however, is only the bladder of the Self. Surely your bladder 
would have burst if you had not come to me." 


 


Chapter XVII — The Feet of the Vaisvanara Self 
1—2 


Then he said to Uddalaka the son of Aruna: "O Gautama, 
whom do you meditate on as the Self?" 

"The earth only, venerable King," he replied. 

"The Self you meditate on," said the king, "is the Vaisvanara 
Self called Pratishtha (the support). Therefore you are 
supported by offspring and cattle and you eat food and see what 
is pleasing. Whoever thus meditates on the Vaisvanara Self eats 
food, sees what is pleasing and has in his family the glory of 
Brahman. That, however, is only the feet of the Self. Surely 
your feet would have withered away if you had not come to 


W 


me. 
Chapter XVIII — The Vaisvanara Self as the Whole 
1 


Then he (the king) said to them all: "You being endowed with 
limited knowledge eat your food, knowing that Vaisvanara Self 
as if He were many. But he who worships the Vaisvanara Self 
as the measure of the span from earth to heaven and as identical 
with the self, eats food in all worlds, in all beings and in all 
selves. 


2 


"Of this Vaisvanara Self the head is Sutejas (the Good Light), 
the eye Visvarupa (the Universal Form), the prana 
Prithagvartma (of various courses), the trunk Bahula (full), the 
bladder Rayi (wealth), the feet Prithivi (the earth), the chest the 
Vedi (altar), the hair the kusa grass on the altar, the heart the 
Garhapatya Fire, the mind the Anvaharya Fire and the mouth 
the Ahavaniya Fire." 


Chapter XIX — Performance of the Agnihotra in Oneself 
(The Prana) 


1 
Therefore the food that comes first should be offered as an 
oblation. The first oblation that he (i.e. the eater) offers, he 


should offer, saying: "Svaha to the prana!" Then the prana is 
satisfied. 


 


2 


The prana being satisfied, the eye is satisfied. The eye being 
satisfied, the sun is satisfied. The sun being satisfied, heaven is 
satisfied. Heaven being satisfied, whatever is under heaven and 
under the sun is satisfied. They being satisfied, he (i.e. the eater 
or sacrificer) is satisfied with offspring, cattle, food, brightness 
of the body and the light of Brahman. 


Chapter XX — The Vyana 
1 


The second oblation that he offers, he should offer, saying: 
"Svaha to the vyana!" Then the vyana is satisfied. 


2 


The vyana being satisfied, the ear is satisfied. The ear being 
satisfied, the moon is satisfied. The moon being satisfied, the 
quarters are satisfied. The quarters being satisfied, whatever is 
under the quarters and under the moon is satisfied. They being 
satisfied, the eater is satisfied with offspring, cattle, food, 
brightness of the body and the light of Brahman. 


Chapter XX — The Apana 
1 


The third oblation that he offers, he should offer, saying: 
"Svaha to the apana!" Then the apana is satisfied. 


2 


The apana being satisfied, speech (i.e. the tongue) is satisfied. 
Speech being satisfied, fire is satisfied. Fire being satisfied, the 
earth is satisfied. The earth being satisfied, what is under the 
earth and under fire is satisfied. They being satisfied, the eater 
is satisfied with offspring, cattle, food, brightness of the body 
and the light of Brahman. 


Chapter XXII — The Samana 
1 


The fourth oblation that he offers, he should offer, saying: 
"Svaha to the samana!" Then the samana is satisfied. 


 


2 


The samana being satisfied, the mind is satisfied. The mind 
being satisfied, the rain—god is satisfied. The rain—god being 
satisfied, the lightning is satisfied. The lightning being 
satisfied, what is under the lightning and under the rain—god is 
satisfied. They being satisfied, the eater is satisfied with 
offspring, cattle, food, brightness of the body and the light of 
Brahman. 


Chapter XXIII — The Udana 
1 


The fifth oblation that he offers, he should offer, saying: 
"Svaha to the udana!" Then the udana is satisfied. 


2 


The udana being satisfied, the skin is satisfied. The skin being 
satisfied, the air is satisfied. The air being satisfied, the akasa is 
satisfied. The akasa being satisfied, what is under the air and 
under the akasa is satisfied. They being satisfied, the eater is 
satisfied with offspring, cattle, food, brightness of the body and 
the light of Brahman. 


Chapter XXIV — The Glory of the Agnihotra Sacrifice 

1 

If, without knowing this knowledge of the Vaisvanara Self, one 
offers an Agnihotra oblation, it is like an oblation offered in 
dead ashes after removing the live coals. 

2 

But if; knowing this, one offers an Agnihotra oblation, it is like 
an oblation offered in all the worlds, in all beings and in all 
atmans. 

3 

Even as the soft fibres of the ishika reed, when thrown into fire, 


are burnt, so also are burnt all the sins of one who, knowing 
this, offers an Agnihotra oblation. 


 


4 


Therefore even if a man who knows this gives what is left of 
his food to a chandala, he verily offers it to his Vaisvanara Self. 
On this there is the following verse: 


5 


"As here on earth hungry children gather around their mother, 
so do all beings gather around the Agnihotra sacrifice, yea 
around the Agnihotra sacrifice." 


Part Six 
Chapter I — The Non—Duality of the Self 
1 


Om. There once lived Svetaketu the grandson of Aruna. To him 
his father said: "Svetaketu, lead the life of a brahmacharin; for 
there is none belonging to our family, my dear, who, not having 
studied the Vedas, is a brahmin only by birth." 


2—3 


Svetaketu went to his teacher's house when he was twelve 
years old and studied the Vedas till he was twenty—four. Then 
he returned to his father, serious, considering himself well read 
and arrogant. 

His father said to him: "Svetaketu, since you are now so 
serious, think yourself well read and are so arrogant, have you, 
my dear, ever asked for that instruction by which one hears 
what cannot be heard, by which one perceives what cannot be 
perceived, by which one knows what cannot be known?" 
Svetaketu asked: "What is that instruction, venerable Sir?" 


4—6 


"Just as, my dear, by one clod of clay all that is made of clay is 
known, the modification being only a name, arising from 
speech, while the truth is that all is clay; 

"Just as, my dear, by one nugget of gold all that is made of gold 
is known, the modification being only a name, arising from 
speech, while the truth is that all is gold; 

"And just as, my dear, by one pair of nail—scissors all that is 
made of iron is known, the modification being only a name, 
arising from speech, while the truth is that all is iron—even so, 
my dear, is that instruction." 


 


a 


"Surely those venerable men did not know that. For if they had 
known it, why should they not have told it to me? Therefore do 
you, venerable Sir, tell me about it." 

"So be it, my dear," said the father. 


Chapter II — Brahman: the Cause of the Universe 
1 


"In the beginning, my dear, this universe was Being (Sat) alone, 
one only without a second. Some say that in the beginning this 
was non—being (asat) alone, one only without a second; and 
from that non—being, being was born." 


2 


Aruni said: "But how, indeed, could it be thus, my dear? How 
could Being be born from non—being? No, my dear, it was 
Being alone that existed in the beginning, one only without a 
second. 


3 


"It (Being, or Brahman) thought: 'May I be many; may I grow 
forth.' It created fire. That fire thought: 'May I be many; may I 
grow forth.' It created water. That is why, whenever a person is 
hot and perspires, water is produced from fire (heat) alone. 


4 


"That water thought: 'May I be many; may I grow forth.' It 
created food (i.e. earth). That is why, whenever it rains 
anywhere, abundant food is produced. From water alone is 
edible food produced. 


Chapter III — The Threefold Development 

1 

"Of all these living beings, there are only three origins: those 
born from an egg, those born from a living being and those 
born from a sprout. 

2 

"That Deity thought: 'Let Me now enter into those three deities 


by means of this living self and let Me then develop names and 
forms.' 


 


3 


"That Deity, having thought: 'Let Me make each of these three 
tripartite,' entered into these three deities by means of the 
living self and developed names and forms. 


4 


"It made each of these tripartite; and how these three deities 
became, each of them, tripartite, that learn from me now, my 
dear. 


Chapter IV — The Threefold Development further 
explained 


1 


"The red colour of gross fire is the colour of the original fire; 
the white colour of gross fire is the colour of the original water; 
the black colour of gross fire is the colour of the original earth. 
Thus vanishes from fire what is commonly called fire, the 
modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the 
three colours (forms) alone are true. 


2 


"The red colour of the sun is the colour of fire, the white the 
colour of water, the black the colour of earth. Thus vanishes 
from the sun what is commonly called the sun, the modification 
being only a name, arising from speech, while the three colours 
alone are true. 


3 


"The red colour of the moon is the colour of fire, the white the 
colour of water, the black the colour of earth. Thus vanishes 
from the moon what is commonly called the moon, the 
modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the 
three colours alone are true. 


4 


"The red colour of lightning is the colour of fire, the white the 
colour of water, the black the colour of earth. Thus vanishes 
from lightning what is commonly called lighting, the 
modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the 
three colours alone are true. 


 


5 


"It was just through this knowledge that the great householders 
and great Vedic scholars of olden times declared: 'No one can 
now mention to us anything which we have not heard, thought 
of, or known.' They knew all from these three forms. 


6—7 


"Whatever, appeared red they knew to be the colour of fire; 
whatever appeared white they knew to be the colour of water; 
whatever appeared black they knew to be the colour of earth. 
"Whatever appeared to be unknown they knew to be the 
combination of these three deities (i.e. colours). Now learn 
from me, my dear, how these three deities, when they reach 
man, become each of them tripartite. 


Chapter V — The Threefold Nature of Food 
1 


"Food when eaten becomes threefold. What is coarsest in it 
becomes faeces, what is medium becomes flesh and what is 
subtlest becomes mind. 


2 


"Water when drunk becomes threefold. What is coarsest in it 
becomes urine, what is medium becomes blood and what is 
subtlest becomes prana. 


3 


"Fire when eaten becomes threefold. What is coarsest in it 
becomes bone, what is medium becomes marrow and what is 
subtlest becomes speech. 


4 


"The mind, my dear, consists of food, the prana of water and 
speech of heat." 

"Please, venerable Sir, instruct me further." 

"So be it, my dear" 


 


Chapter VI — The Physical Nature of the Mind, the Prana 
and Speech 


1 


"That, my dear, which is the subtlest part of curds rises, when 
they are churned and becomes butter. 


2 


"In the same manner, my dear, that which is the subtlest part of 
the food that is eaten rises and becomes mind. 


3 


"The subtlest part of the water that is drunk rises and becomes 
prana. 


4 


"The subtlest part of the fire that is eaten rises and becomes 
speech. 


5 


"Thus, my dear, the mind consists of food, the prana consists of 
water and speech consists of fire." 

"Please, venerable Sir, instruct me further." 

"So be it, my dear" 


Chapter VII — How the Mind consists of Food 
1 


"A person, my dear, consists of sixteen parts. Do not eat any 
food for fifteen days, but drink as much water as you like. 
Since the prana consists of water, it will not be cut off if you 
drink water." 


2 

Svetaketu did not eat any food for fifteen days. Then he came 
to his father and said: "What, Sir, shall I recite?" 

His father said: "The Rik, Yagus and Saman verses." 

He replied: "They do not occur to me, Sir." 


a 


His father said to him: "Just as, my dear, of a great blazing fire 
a single coal, the size of a firefly, may be left, which would not 


 


burn much more than that, even so, my dear, of your sixteen 
parts only one part is left; and therefore with that one part you 
do not remember the Vedas. Now go and eat and you will 
understand me." 


4 


Svetaketu ate and approached his father. Then whatever his 
father asked him, he showed that he knew it. 


5—6 


Then his father said to him: "Just as, my dear, of a great lighted 
fire a single coal the size of a firefly, if left, may be made to 
blaze up again by adding grass to it and will thus burn much 
more, 

"Even so, my dear; of your sixteen parts only one part was left 
and that, when strengthened by food, blazed up. With it you 
now remember the Vedas. Therefore, my dear, the mind 
consists of food, the prana consists of water and speech consists 
of fire." 

After that he understood what his father said, yea, he 
understood it. 


Chapter VIII — Concerning Sleep, Hunger, Thirst and 
Death 


1 


Uddalaka the son of Aruna said to his son Svetaketu: "Learn 
from me, my dear, the true nature of sleep. When a person has 
entered into deep sleep, as it is called, then, my dear, he 
becomes united with Pure Being (Sat), he has gone to his own 
Self. That is why they say he is in deep sleep (svapiti); it is 
because he has gone (apita) to his own (svam). 


2 


"Just as a bird tied by a string to the hand of the bird—catcher 
first flies in every direction and then finding no rest anywhere, 
settles down at the place where it is bound, so also the mind 
(i.e. the individual soul reflected in the mind), my dear, after 
flying in every direction and finding no rest anywhere, settles 
down in the Prana (i.e. Pure Being); for the mind (the 
individual soul) is fastened to the Prana (Pure Being). 


3 
"Learn from me, my dear, what hunger and thirst are. When a 


man is hungry, as they say, it is water that has led (1.e. carried 


 


away) what was eaten. Therefore, just as they speak of a leader 
of cows, a leader of horses, a leader of men, so do they speak of 
water as the leader of food. So, my dear, know this offshoot 
(i.e. the body) to have sprung forth from a cause, for it cannot 
be without a root. 


4 


"And where could its root be except in food (earth)? And in the 
same way, my dear, as food too is an offshoot, seek for water as 
its root. And as water too, my dear, is an offshoot, seek for fire 
as its root. And as fire too, my dear, is an offshoot, seek for 
Being (Sat) as its root. Yes, all these creatures, my dear, have 
their root in Being, they dwell in Being, they finally rest in 
Being.

"When a man is said to be thirsty, it is fire that has led (i.e. 
carried away) what was drunk by him. Therefore as they speak 
of a leader of cows, a leader of horses, a leader of men, so do 
they speak of fire as the leader of water. So, my dear, know this 
offshoot (the body) to have sprung forth from a cause, for it 
cannot be without a root. 


6 


"And where could its root be except in water? And in the same 
way, my dear, as water is an offshoot, seek for fire as its root. 
And as fire too, my dear, is an offshoot, seek for Being as its 
root. Yes, my dear, all these creatures have their root in Being, 
they dwell in Being, they finally rest in Being. 

"And how these three deities (fire, water and earth), on 
reaching a human being, become each of them tripartite has 
already been said. When a person departs hence, his speech 
merges in his mind, his mind in his prana, his prana in heat 
(fire) and the heat in the Highest Being. 


7 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 

 


Chapter IX — The Absence of Individuality in Deep Sleep 
1—2 


"As bees, my dear, make honey by collecting the juices of trees 
located at different places and reduce them to one form, 

"And as these juices have no discrimination so as to be able to 
say: 'I am the juice of this tree,' or 'I am the juice of that 
tree'—even so, indeed, my dear, all these creatures, though 
they reach Pure Being, do not know that they have reached 
Pure Being. 


3 


"Whatever these creatures are, here in this world—a tiger, a 
lion, a wolf, a boar, a worm, a fly, a gnat, or a mosquito—that 
they become again. 


4 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


Chapter X — The Absence of Particularized Consciousness 
in Deep Sleep 


1—2 


"These rivers, my dear, flow—the eastern toward the east and 
the western toward the west. They arise from the sea and flow 
into the sea. Just as these rivers, while they are in the sea, do 
not know: 'I am this river' or 'I am that river,' 

"Even so, my dear, all these creatures, even though they have 
come from Pure Being, do not know that they have come from 
Pure Being. Whatever these creatures are, here in this world—a 
tiger, a lion, a wolf a boar, a worm, a fly, a gnat, or a mosquito, 
that they become again. 


3 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


 


Chapter XI — The Indestructibility of the Jiva 
1 


"If, my dear, someone were to strike at the root of this large 
tree here, it would bleed but live. If he were to strike at the 
middle, it would bleed but live. If he were to strike at the top, it 
would bleed but live. Pervaded by the living self, that tree 
stands firm, drinking in again and again its nourishment and 
rejoicing. 


2 


"But if the life (i.e. living self) leaves one of its branches, that 
branch withers; if it leaves a second, that branch withers; if it 
leaves a third, that branch withers. If it leaves the whole tree, 

the whole three withers. 


3 


"In exactly the same manner, my dear," said he, "know this: 
This body dies, bereft of the living self; but the living self dies 
not. 

"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


Chapter XII — The Birth of the Gross from the Subtle 
1 


"Bring me a fruit of that nyagrodha (banyan) tree." 
"Here it is' venerable Sir." "Break it." 

"It is broken, venerable Sir." 

"What do you see there?" 

"These seeds, exceedingly small, 

"Break one of these, my son." 

"It is broken, venerable Sir." 

"What do you see there?" 

"Nothing at all, venerable Sir." 


Z 
The father said: "That subtle essence, my dear, which you do 
not perceive there—from that very essence this great nyagrodha 


arises. 
Believe me, my dear. 


 


3 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


Chapter XIII — The Invisibility of an Existent Object 
1 


"Place this salt in water and then come to me in the morning." 
The son did as he was told. 

The father said to him: "My son, bring me the salt which you 
placed in the water last night." 

Looking for it, the son did not find it, for it was completely 
dissolved. 


2 


The father said: "My son, take a sip of water from the surface. 
How is it?" 

"It is salt." 

"Take a sip from the middle. How is it?" 

"It is salt." 

"Take a sip from the bottom. How is it?" 

"It is salt." 

"Throw it away and come to me." 

The son did as he was told, saying: "The salt was there all the 
time." 

Then the father said: "Here also, my dear, in this body you do 
not perceive Sat (Being); but It is indeed there." 


3 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


Chapter XIV — The Means of Self—Knowledge 
1 
"Just as someone, my dear, might lead a person, with his eyes 


covered, away from the country of the Gandharas and leave 


 


him in a place where there were no human beings; and just as 
that person would turn toward the east, or the north, or the 
south, or the west, shouting: 'I have been brought here with my 
eyes covered, I have been left here with my eyes covered!' 


2 


"And as thereupon someone might loosen the covering and say 
to him: "Gandhara is in that direction; go that way'; and as 
thereupon, having been informed and being capable of 
judgement, he would, by asking his way from one village to 
another, arrive at last at Gandhara—in exactly the same manner 
does a man who has found a teacher to instruct him obtain the 
true knowledge. For him there is delay only so long as he is not 
liberated from the body; then he reaches perfection. 


3 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the 
son. 

"So be it, my dear," the father replied. 


Chapter XV — Ultimate Liberation 
1 


"Around a dying person afflicted with illness, my dear, his 
relatives gather and ask: 'Do you know me? Do you know me?' 
He knows them as long as his speech is not merged in his mind, 
his mind in his prana (breath), his prana in heat (fire) and the 
heat in the Highest Deity. 


2 


"But when his speech is merged in his mind, his mind in his 
prana, his prana in heat and the heat in the Highest Deity, then 
he does not know them. 


3 


"Now, that which is the subtle essence—in it all that exists has 
its self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 

"Please, venerable Sir, give me further instruction," said the son 
"So be it, my dear;" the father replied. 


 


Chapter X VI — Liberation for the Knower of Brahman 
1 


"My dear, they (i.e. the police) bring a man whom they have 
seized by the hand and say: "He has taken something, he has 
committed a theft.' When he denies it, they say: 'Heat the axe 
for him.' If he has committed the theft but denies it, then he 
makes himself a liar. Being false—minded, he covers himself 
with falsehood, grasps the heated axe and is burnt. Then he is 
killed. 


2 


"But if he did not commit the theft, then he makes himself what 
he really is. Being true—minded, he covers himself with truth, 
grasps the heated axe and is not burnt. He is released. 


3 


"As that truthful man is not burnt so also one who has known 
Sat is not born again. Thus in That (Sat) all that exists has its 
self. That is the True. That is the Self. That thou art, 
Svetaketu." 


Part Seven 


Chapter I — Dialogue between Narada and Sanatkumara 
I 


Om. Narada approached Sanatkumara as a pupil and said: 
"Venerable Sir, please teach me." 

Sanatkumara said to him: "Please tell me what you already 
know. 

Then I shall tell you what is beyond." 


2 


Narada said: "Venerable Sir, I know the Rig—Veda, the 
Yajur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, the Atharva—Veda as the 
fourth Veda, the epics (Puranas) and ancient lore (Itihasa) as 
the fifth, the Veda of the Vedas (i.e. grammar), the rules of the 
sacrifices by which the Manes are gratified, the science of 
numbers, the science of portents, the science of time, logic, 
ethics, etymology, Brahma—vidya (i.e. the science of 
pronunciation, ceremonials, prosody, etc.), the science of 
elemental spirits, the science of weapons, astronomy, the 
science of serpents and the fine arts. All this I know, venerable 
Sir. 


 


3 


"But, venerable Sir, with all this I know words only; I do not 
know the Self. I have heard from men like you that he who 
knows the Self overcomes sorrow. I am one afflicted with 
sorrow. Do you, venerable Sir, help me to cross over to the 
other side of sorrow." 

Sanatkumara said to him: "Whatever you have read is only a 
name. 


4 


"Verily, a name is the Rig—Veda; so also are the Yajur— 
Veda, the Sama—Veda, the Atharva—Veda as the fourth Veda, 
the epics and the ancient lore as the fifth, the Veda of the 
Vedas, the rules of the sacrifices by which the Manes are 
gratified, the science of numbers, the science of portents, the 
science of time, logic, ethics, etymology, Brahma—vidya, the 
science of elemental spirits, the science of weapons, astronomy, 
the science of serpents and the fine arts. 

"Meditate on the name. 


5 


"He who meditates on a name as Brahman can, of his own free 
will, reach as far as the name reaches—he who meditates on a 
name as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than a 
name?" 

"Of course there is something greater than a name." "Please tell 
that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter II — Speech as Brahman 
1 


"Speech is, verily, greater than a name. Speech makes one 
understand the Rig—Veda, the Yajur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, 
the Atharva—Veda as the fourth, the epics and the ancient lore 
as the fifth, the Veda of the Vedas, the rules of sacrifices by 
which the Manes are gratified, the science of numbers, the 
science of portents, the science of time, logic, ethics, 
etymology, Brahma—vidya, the science of elemental spirits, 
the science of weapons, astronomy, the science of serpents and 
the fine arts, as well as heaven, earth, air, akasa, water, fire, 
gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, animals, together with 
worms, flies and ants, as also righteousness and 
unrighteousness, the true and the false, the good and the bad, 
the pleasant and the unpleasant. 

"Verily, if there were no speech, neither righteousness nor 


 


unrighteousness would be known, neither the true nor the false, 
neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant. 
"Speech, verily, makes us know all this. Meditate upon speech. 


2 


"He who meditates on speech as Brahman can, of his own free 
will, reach as far as speech reaches—he who meditates on 
speech as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
speech?" 

"Of course there is something greater than speech." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter II — Mind as Brahman 
1 


"The mind is, verily, greater than speech. Just as the closed fist 
holds two amalakas, or two plums, or two aksha fruits, so does 
the mind hold speech and a name. For when a man thinks in his 
mind that he would read the sacred hymns, then he reads them. 
When he thinks in his mind that he would perform actions, then 
he performs them. When he thinks in his mind that he would 
have sons and cattle, then he desires them. When he thinks in 
his mind that he would have this world and the other, then he 
desires them. Mind, indeed, is the self; mind is the world; mind 
is Brahman. 

"Meditate on the mind. 


2 


"He who meditates on mind as Brahman can, of his own free 
will, reach as far as mind reaches—he who meditates on mind 
as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
mind?" 

"Of course there is something greater than mind." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter IV — Will as Brahman 

1 

"Will (Samkalpa) is, verily, greater than mind. For when a man 
wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he utters speech and then 
he employs speech in the recital of a name. The sacred hymns 


are included in a name and all sacrifices are included in the 
sacred hymns. 


 


2 


"Will, indeed, is the goal of all these beginning with mind and 
ending in sacrifice; from will they arise and in will they all 
abide. Heaven and earth willed, air and akasa willed, water and 
fire willed. Through the will of heaven and earth, etc. the rain 
wills; through the will of the rain, food wills; through the will 
of food, the pranas will; through the will of the pranas, the 
sacred hymns will; through the will of the sacred hymns, the 
sacrifices will; through the will of the sacrifices, the world 
wills; through the will of the world, everything wills. Such is 
will. 

Meditate on will. 


3 


"He who meditates on will as Brahman can, of his own free 
will, reach as far as will reaches—he who meditates on will as 
Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
will?" 

"Of course there is something greater than will." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter V — Consideration as Brahman 
1 


"Consideration (Chitta) is, verily, greater than will. For when a 
man considers, then he wills, then he thinks in his mind, then 
he utters speech, then he engages speech in the recitation of a 
name. The sacred hymns are included in a name and all 
sacrifices are included in the sacred hymns. 


2 


"Consideration is, indeed, the goal of all these beginning with 
mind and ending in sacrifice; from consideration they arise and 
in consideration they all abide. Therefore if a person is without 
consideration, even though he possesses much knowledge, 
people say of him that he is nothing and whatever he knows is 
useless; for if he were really learned, he would not be so 
inconsiderate. But if a person is considerate, though he knows 
but little, to him people are eager to listen. Consideration, 
indeed, is the goal of all these; consideration is the self; 
consideration is the support. 

Meditate on consideration. 


 


3 


"He who meditates on consideration as Brahman, he, being 
permanent, firm and undistressed, obtains the worlds which are 
permanent, firm and undistressed; he can, of his own free win, 
reach as far as consideration reaches—he who meditates on 
consideration as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
consideration?" 

"Of course there is something greater than consideration." 
"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter VI — Meditation as Brahman 
1 


"Meditation (Dhyana) is, verily, greater than consideration. 
Earth meditates, as it were. The mid—region meditates, as it 
were. Heaven meditates, as it were. The waters meditate, as it 
were. The mountains meditate, as it were. The gods meditate, 
as it were. Men meditate, as it were. Therefore he who, among 
men, attains greatness here on earth seems to have obtained a 
share of meditation. Thus while small people are quarrelsome, 
abusive and slandering, great men appear to have obtained a 
share of meditation. Meditate on meditation. 


2 


"He who meditates on meditation as Brahman, can, of his own 
free will, reach as far as meditation reaches—he who meditates 
on meditation as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
meditation?" 

"Of course there is something greater than meditation." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter VII — Understanding as Brahman 
1 


"Understanding is, verily, greater than meditation. 
Understanding makes one understand the Rig—Veda, the 
Yajur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, the Atharva—Veda as the 
fourth, the epics and the ancient lore as the fifth, the Veda of 
the Vedas, the rules of sacrifices by which the Manes are 
gratified, the science of numbers, the science of portents, the 
science of time, logic, ethics, etymology, Brahma—vidya, the 
science of elemental spirits, the science of weapons, astronomy, 
the science of serpents and the fine arts; heaven, earth, air, 
water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees; animals, 


 


together with worms, flies and ants; and also righteousness and 
unrighteousness, the true and the false, the good and the bad, 
the pleasant and the unpleasant, food and taste, this world and 
yonder world. Meditate on understanding. 


2 


"He who meditates on understanding as Brahman attains the 
worlds of understanding and knowledge and can, of his own 
free will, reach as far as understanding reaches—he who 
meditates on understanding as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
understanding?" 

"Of course there is something greater than understanding." 
"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter VIII — Strength as Brahman 
1 


"Strength is, verily, greater than understanding. One strong man 
causes a hundred men of understanding to tremble. When a 
man is strong he can rise. If he rises he can attend on the 
teachers. If he attends on them he can become their intimate 
companion as a pupil. If he is their intimate companion he can 
watch their conduct, listen to their instruction, reflect on what 
he hears, become convinced of what he reflects on, act and 
enjoy the result of action. By strength the earth stands firm, by 
strength the mid—region, by strength heaven, by strength the 
mountains, by strength the gods and men, by strength cattle and 
birds, herbs and trees and animals, together with worms, flies 
and ants, by strength the world stands firm. Meditate upon 
strength." 


2 


"He who meditates on strength as Brahman can, of his own free 
will, reach as far as strength reaches—he who meditates on 
strength as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
strength?" 

"Of course there is something greater than strength." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter IX — Food as Brahman 
1 
"Food is, verily, greater than strength. Therefore if a man 


abstains from food for ten days, even though he might live, yet 


 


he would not be able to see, hear, reflect, become convinced, 
act, or enjoy the result. But when he obtains food, he is able to 
see, hear, reflect, become convinced, act and enjoy the result. 


2 


"He who meditates on food as Brahman obtains the world rich 
in food and drink; he can, of his own free will, reach as far as 
food reaches—he who meditates on food as Brahman." 
Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
food?" 

"Of course there is something greater than food." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter X — Water as Brahman 
1 


"Water is, verily, greater than food. Therefore if there is not 
sufficient rain, then living creatures are afflicted with the 
thought that there will be less food. But if there is sufficient 
rain, then living creatures rejoice in the thought that there will 
be much food. It is water that assumes the form of this earth, 
this mid—region, this heaven, these mountains, these gods and 
men, cattle and birds, herbs and trees and animals, together 
with worms, flies and ants. Water indeed is all these forms. 
Meditate on water. 


2 


"He who meditates on water as Brahman obtains all his desires 
and becomes satisfied; he can, of his own free will, reach as far 
as water reaches—he who meditates on water as Brahman." 
Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
water?" 

"Of course there is something greater than water." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter XI — Fire as Brahman 
i 


"Fire is, verily, greater than water. For, having seized the air, it 
warms the akasa. Then people say: 'It is hot, it burns; it will 
rain.' Thus does fire first manifest itself and then create water. 
Furthermore, thunderclaps roll with lightning upward and 
across the sky. Then people say: 'There is lightning, there is 
thunder; it will rain.' Here also does fire first manifest itself and 
then create water. Meditate on fire. 


 


2 


"He who meditates on fire as Brahman becomes radiant himself 
and obtains radiant worlds, full of light and free from darkness; 
he can, of his own free will, reach as far as fire reaches—he 
who meditates on fire as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
fire?" 

"Of course there is something greater than fire." 

"Please tell that to me, Venerable Sir." 


Chapter XII — The Akasa as Brahman 
1 


"The akasa is, verily, greater than fire. For in the akasa exist 
both the sun and the moon, lightning, stars and fire. It is 
through the akasa that a person calls another; it is through the 
akasa that the other hears; it is through the akasa that the person 
hears back. In the akasa we rejoice when we are together and in 
the akasa we rejoice not when we are separated. In the akasa 
everything is born and toward the akasa all things grow. 
Meditate upon the akasa. 


2 


"He who meditates on the akasa as Brahman obtains the worlds 
extending far and wide, luminous, free from pain and spacious; 
he can, of his own free will, reach as far as the akasa reaches— 
he who meditates on the akasa as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than the 
akasa?" 

"Of course there is something greater than the akasa." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter XIII — Memory as Brahman 
1 


"Memory is, verily, greater than the akasa. Therefore even 
when many people assemble, if they had no memory they 
would not hear anyone at all, they would not think, they would 
not understand. But surely, if they had memory, they would 
hear, think and understand. Through memory one knows one's 
sons, through memory one's cattle. Meditate on memory. 


2 
"He who meditates on memory as Brahman can, of his own 


free will, reach as far as memory reaches—he who meditates 


 


on memory as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
memory?" 

"Of course there is something greater than memory." 
"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter XIV — Hope as Brahman 
1 


"Hope is, verily, greater than memory. Kindled by hope, a 
person endowed with memory reads the sacred hymns, 
performs sacrifices, desires sons and cattle; desires this world 
and the other. Meditate on hope. 


2 


"He who meditates on hope as Brahman—all his desires are 
fulfilled through hope, his prayers are not in vain; he can, of his 
own free will, reach as far as hope reaches—he who meditates 
on hope as Brahman." 

Narada said: "Venerable Sir, is there anything greater than 
hope?" 

"Of course there is something greater than hope." 

"Please tell that to me, venerable Sir." 


Chapter XV — The Prana as Brahman 
1 


"The prana is, verily, greater than hope. As the spokes of a 
wheel are fastened to the nave, so are all these beginning with 
the name and ending with hope fastened to the prana. The prana 
moves by the prana. The prana gives the prana to the prana. 

The prana is the father, the prana is the mother, the prana is the 
brother, the prana is the sister, the prana is the teacher, the 
prana is the brahmin. 


2 


"If one says something unbecoming to a father, mother, 
brother, sister, teacher, or brahmin, then people say: 'Shame on 
you! Verily, you are a slayer of your father, a slayer of your 
mother, a slayer of your brother, a slayer of your sister, a slayer 
of your teacher, a slayer of a brahmin.' 


a 


"But if; when the prana has departed from them, one shoves 
them together with a poker and burns every bit of them, no one 


 


would say: 'You are a slayer of your father, a slayer of your 
mother, a slayer of your brother, a slayer of your sister, a slayer 
of your teacher, a slayer of a brahmin." 


4 


"The prana, verily, is all this. He (i.e. the knower of the prana) 
who sees this, reflects on this, is convinced of this, becomes an 
ativadi (superior speaker). If people say to such a man: 'You 
are an ativadi,' he may say: 'Yes, I am an ativadi'; he need not 
deny it." 


Chapter X VI — The Knowledge of the Truth 
1 


"But in reality he is an ativadi who has become an ativadi by 
the knowledge of the True." 

"May I, venerable Sir, become an ativadi by the knowledge of 
the True." 

"But one should desire to know the True." 

"Venerable Sir, I desire to know the True." 


Chapter X VII — Truth depends upon Understanding 
i 


Sanatkumara said: "When one understands the True, only then 
does one declare the True. One who does not understand the 
True does not declare It. Only one who understands It declares 
the True. One must desire to understand this understanding." 
"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand." 


Chapter X VIII — Understanding depends upon Reflection 
1 

"When one reflects, only then does one understand. One Who 
does not reflect does not understand. Only one who reflects 
understands. One must desire to understand this reflection." 
"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand reflection." 

Chapter XIX — Reflection depends upon Faith 

1 

"When one has faith, only then does one reflect. One who does 
not have faith does not reflect. Only one who has faith reflects. 


One must desire to understand faith." 
"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand faith." 


 


Chapter XX — Faith depends upon Single—Mindedness 
1 


"When one is single—minded in one's devotion to the teacher, 
only then does one have faith. One who does not have single— 
mindedness does not have faith. Only one who has single— 
mindedness has faith. One must desire to understand single— 
mindedness." 

"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand single—mindedness." 


Chapter X XI — Single—Mindedness depends upon 
Concentration 


1 


"When one performs one's duties (i.e. practises concentration), 
only then does one have single—mindedness. One who does 
not perform his duties does not have single—mindedness. Only 
one who performs his duties has single—mindedness. One 
must desire to understand the performance of duties." 
"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand the performance of 
duties." 


Chapter XXII — Concentration depends upon Bliss 
1 


"When one obtains bliss, only then does one perform one's 

duties. One who does not obtain bliss does not perform his 

duties. Only one who obtains bliss performs his duties. One 
must desire to understand bliss." 

"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand bliss." 


Chapter XXIV — The Infinite is Bliss 

1 

"The infinite is bliss. There is no bliss in anything finite. Only 
the Infinite is bliss. One must desire to understand the Infinite." 
"Venerable Sir, I desire to understand the Infinite." 

Chapter XXIV — The Infinite and the Finite 

1 

"Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands 
nothing else—that is the Infinite. Where one sees something 


else, hears something else, understands something else—that is 
the finite. The Infinite is immortal, the finite mortal." 


 


"Venerable Sir, in what does the Infinite find Its support?" 
"In Its own greatness—or not even in greatness." 


2 


"Here on earth people describe cows and horses, elephants and 
gold, slaves and wives, fields and houses, as 'greatness.' I do 
not mean this," he said, "for in such cases one thing finds its 
support in another. But what I say is: 


Chapter XX V — Instruction about the Infinite 
1 


"That infinite, indeed, is below. It is above. It is behind. It is 
before. It is to the south. It is to the north. The Infinite, indeed, 
is all this. 

"Next follows the instruction about the Infinite with reference 
to 'T: 

I, indeed, am below. I am above. I am behind. I am before. I am 
to the south. I am to the north. I am, indeed, all this. 


2 


"Next follows the instruction about the Infinite with reference 
to the Self: The Self indeed, is below. It is above. It is behind. It 
is before. It is to the south. It is to the north. The Self, indeed, is 
all this. 

"Verily, he who sees this, reflects on this and understands this 
delights in the Self sports with the Self, rejoices in the Self 
revels in the Self. Even while living in the body he becomes a 
self—tuler. He wields unlimited freedom in all the worlds. 
But those who think differently from this have others for their 
rulers they live in perishable worlds. They have no freedom in 
all the worlds." 


Chapter XX VI — Self—knowledge 
1 


"For him who sees this, reflects on this and understands this, 
the prana springs from the Self, hope springs from the Self, 
memory springs from the Self, the akasa springs from the Self, 
fire springs from the Self; water springs from the Self; 
appearance and disappearance spring from the Self, food 
springs from the Self, strength springs from the Self; 
understanding springs from the Self, meditation springs from 
the Self, consideration springs from the Self, will springs from 
the Self; mind springs from the Self speech springs from the 
Self, the name springs from the Self the sacred hymns spring 


 


from the Self the sacrifices spring from the Self—ay, all this 
springs from the Self." 


2 


"On this there is the following verse: 

"The knower of Truth does not see death or disease or sorrow. 
The knower of Truth sees everything and obtains everything 
everywhere.' 

"He (the knower) is one before the creation, becomes three, 
becomes five, becomes seven, becomes nine; then again he is 
called eleven, one hundred and ten and one thousand and 
twenty. 

"Now is described the discipline for inner purification by which 
Self—Knowledge is attained: When the food is pure, the mind 
becomes pure. When the mind is pure the memory becomes 
firm. When the memory is firm all ties are loosened." 

The venerable Sanatkumara showed Narada, after his blemishes 
had been wiped out, the other side of darkness. They call 
Sanatkumara Skanda, yea, Skanda they call him. 


Part Eight 
Chapter I — Brahman in the Heart 
1 


Om. There is in this city of Brahman an abode, the small lotus 
of the heart; within it is a small akasa. Now what exists within 
that small akasa, that is to be sought after, that is what one 
should desire to understand. 


2—3 


If they should say to him: "Now, with regard to the abode, the 
small lotus, in this city of Brahman and the small akasa within 
it—what is there in it that is to be sought after and what is there 
that one should desire to understand?" 

Then he (the teacher) should say: "As far as, verily, this great 
akasa extends, so far extends the akasa within the heart. Both 
heaven and earth are contained within it, both fire and air, both 
sun and moon, both lightning and stars; and whatever belongs 
to him (i.e. the embodied creature) in this world and whatever 
does not, all that is contained within it (i.e. the akasa in the 
heart)." 


4 


If they (the pupils) should say: "If everything that exists—all 
beings and all desires—is contained in this city of Brahman, 


 


then what is left of it when old age overcomes it or when it 
perishes?" 


5 


Then he (the teacher) should say: "With the old age of the 
body, That (i.e. Brahman, described as the akasa in the heart) 
does not age; with the death of the body, That does not die. 
That Brahman and not the body is the real city of Brahman. In 
It all desires are contained. It is the Self—free from sin, free 
from old age, free from death, free from grief free from hunger, 
free from thirst; Its desires come true, Its thoughts come true. 
Just as, here on earth, people follow as they are commanded by 
a leader and depend upon whatever objects they desire, be it a 
country or a piece of land so also those who are ignorant of the 
Self depend upon other objects and experience the result of 
their good and evil deeds. 


6 


"And just as, here on earth, whatever is earned through work 
perishes, so does the next world, won by virtuous deeds, perish. 
Those who depart hence without having realized the Self and 
these true desires—for them there is no freedom in all the 
worlds. But those who depart hence after having realized the 
Self and these true desires—for them there is freedom in all the 
worlds. 


Chapter II — The Fulfilment of Desires through Self— 
Knowledge 


1 

"If he desires the World of the Manes, by his mere thought the 
Manes come to him. Having obtained the world of the Manes 
he is happy. 

2 

"And if he desires the world of the mothers, by his mere 
thought the mothers come to him. Having obtained the world of 
the mothers, he is happy. 

3 

"And if he desires the world of the brothers, by his mere 


thought the brothers come to him. Having obtained the world of 
the brothers, he is happy. 


 


4 


"And if he desires the world of the sisters, by his mere thought 
the sisters come to him. Having obtained the world of the 
sisters, he is happy. 


5 


"And if he desires the world of the friends, by his mere thought 
the friends come to him. Having obtained the world of the 
friends, he is happy. 


6 


"And if he desires the world of perfumes and garlands, by his 
mere thought perfumes and garlands come to him. Having 
obtained the world of perfumes and garlands, he is happy. 


7 


"And if he desires the world of food and drink, by his mere 
thought food and drink come to him. Having obtained the 
world of food and drink, he is happy. 


8 


"And if he desires the world of song and music, by his mere 
thought song and music come to him. Having obtained the 
world of song and music, he is happy. 


9 


"And if he desires the world of women, by his mere thought 
women come to him. Having obtained the world of women, he 


is happy. 
10 


"Whatever country he longs for, whatever objects he desires, by 
his mere thought all these come to him. Having obtained them, 
he is happy. 


Chapter III — The Serene Self and Satya Brahman 

1 

"These true desires are covered by what is false. Though they 
exist always, yet they have a covering which is false. Thus, 


whosoever belonging to the embodied creature has departed 
from this life, him he cannot see in this world with his eyes. 


 


2 


"Those of his fellows who belong to him here and those who 
are dead and whatever else there is which he wishes for and 
does not obtain—he finds all that by going in there (i.e. into his 
own Self). For there, indeed, lie those true desires of his, 
covered by what is false. 

"As people who do not know the spot where a treasure of gold 
has been hidden somewhere in the earth, walk over it again and 
again without finding it, so all these creatures day after day go 
into the World of Brahman and yet do not find it, because they 
are carried away by untruth. 


3 


"That Self abides in the heart. The etymological explanation of 
heart is this: This one (ayam) is in the heart (hridi); therefore It 
is called the heart (hridayam). He who knows this goes every 
day in deep sleep to Heaven (i.e. Brahman, dwelling in the 
heart). 


4 


"Now, this serene being, after rising from this physical body 
and attaining the Highest Light, reaches his own true form. This 
is the Self." Thus he (i.e. the teacher, questioned by his pupils) 
spoke. Continuing, he said: "This is the immortal, the fearless. 
This is Brahman. And of this Brahman the name is Satyam, the 
True." 


5 


This name Satyam consists of three syllables: Sat, ti and yam. 
That which is Sat signifies the Immortal; and that which is ti is 
the mortal; and yam binds them both. Because this syllable 
binds both, therefore it is called yam. He who knows this goes 
every day in deep sleep to Heaven (i.e. Brahman, dwelling in 
the heart). 


Chapter IV — Brahman as a Dam 

1 

The self is a dam, a separating boundary, for keeping these 
worlds apart. This dam is not passed by day and night, by old 


age, death and grief, or by good and evil deeds. All evils turn 
back from It, for the World of Brahman is free from all evil. 


 


2 


Therefore, having reached this dam, he who is blind ceases to 
be blind, he who is miserable ceases to be miserable, he who is 
afflicted with disease ceases to be afflicted. Therefore, having 
reached this dam, the night becomes day; for the World of 
Brahman is lighted once for all. 


3 


That World of Brahman belongs to those who realize It by 
means of continence (brahmacharya)—for them there is 
freedom in all the worlds. 


Chapter V — Continence 
1 


Now, what people call yajna (sacrifice), that is really 
continence. For he who knows Brahman obtains that World of 
Brahman, which others obtain through sacrifice, by means of 
continence. 

What people call ishta (worship), that is really continence. For 
having desired (ishtva) the Knowledge of the Self; by means of 
continence one realizes the Self. 


2 


Now, what people call the Satrayana sacrifice, that is really 
continence. For by means of continence one obtains from the 
True (Sat) the safety (trana) of the self. 

What people call the vow of silence (mauna), that is really 
continence. For after knowing the Self from the scriptures one 
meditates (manute) on It. 


3 

Now, what people call the vow of fasting (anasakayana), that is 
really continence. For that Self does not perish (na nasyati) 
which one realizes by means of continence. 


4 


The World of Brahman belongs to those who obtain by means 
of continence the seas Ara and Nya in the World of Brahman. 
For them there is freedom in all the worlds. 


 


Chapter VI — The Course after Death for the Illumined 
1 


Now, those arteries of the heart are filled with the essences of 
brown, white, blue, yellow and red liquid substances. Verily, 
the sun yonder is brown, it is white, it is blue, it is yellow, it is 
red. 


2 


As a long highway runs between two villages, this one and that 
yonder, so do the rays of the sun go to both worlds, this one and 
that yonder. They start from yonder sun and enter into these 
arteries; they start from these arteries and enter into yonder sun. 


3 


When a man is asleep, with the senses withdrawn and serene 
and sees no dream, then he has entered into these arteries. Then 
no evil touches him, for he has obtained the light of the sun. 


4 


And when he becomes weak, then those sitting around him say: 
"Do you know me? Do you know me?" As long as he has not 
departed from this body, he knows them. 


5 


When he departs from the body if he is a mere ritualist and 
ignorant of Brahman he then goes upward by these rays toward 
the worlds which he has gained by his meritorious work. Or if 
he is a knower of the doctrines of the akasa in the lotus of the 
heart, he then meditates on Om and thus secures entrance into 
Brahmaloka. Or if he is ignorant he attains lower bodies. The 
knower attains the solar orb as quickly as one directs one's 
mind from one object to another. This indeed is the door to the 
World of Brahman for those who know; for the ignorant it is 
closed. 


6 


On this there is the following verse: 

"There are one hundred and one arteries of the heart, one of 
which pierces the crown of the head. Going upward by it, a 
man at death attains immortality. Other arteries, going in 
different directions, only serve as channels for his departing 
from the body, yea, only serve as channels for his departing 
from the body." 


 


Chapter VII — The Person in the Eye 
1 


Prajapati said: "The Self which is free from sin, free from old 
age, free from death, free from grief, free from hunger, free 
from thirst, whose desires come true and whose thoughts come 
true—That it is which should be searched out, That it is which 
one should desire to understand. He who has known this Self 
from the scriptures and a teacher and understood It obtains all 
the worlds and all desires. 


2 


The devas (gods) and asuras (demons) both heard these words 
and said: "Well, let us search out this Self by searching out 
which one obtains all the worlds and all desires." 

Indra, among the gods, went forth and Virochana, among the 
demons. Without communicating with each other, the two came 
into the presence of Prajapati, fuel in hand. 


3 


They dwelt there for thirty—two years, practising 
brahmacharya. Then Prajapati said to them: "For what purpose 
have you both been living here?" 

They said: "A saying of yours is being repeated by learned 
people: 'The Self which is free from sin, free from old age, free 
from death, free from grief, free from hunger, free from thirst, 
whose desires come true and whose thoughts come true—That 
it is which should be searched out, That it is which one should 
desire to understand. He who has known this Self and 
understood It obtains all the worlds and all desires.' Now, we 
both have dwelt here because we desire that Self." 


4 


Prajapati said to them: "The person that is seen in the eye—that 
is the Self." He further said: "This is immortal, fearless. This is 
Brahman." 

They asked: "Venerable Sir, he who is perceived in the water 
and he who is perceived in a mirror—which of these is he?" 
Prajapati replied: "The same one, indeed, is perceived in all 
these." 


 


Chapter VIII — The Doctrine of the Demons 
1 


Prajapati said: "Look at yourself in a pan of water and then 
what you do not understand of the Self come and tell me." 
They cast their glance in a pan of water. Then Prajapati said to 
them: 

"What do you see?" 

They said: "Venerable Sir, we see the entire self even to the 
very hairs and nails, a veritable picture." 


2 


Prajapati said to them: "After you have well adorned yourselves 
with ornaments, put on your best clothes and cleansed 
yourselves, look into the pan of water." 

After having adorned themselves well, put on their best clothes 
and cleansed themselves, they looked into the pan of water. 
"What do you see?" asked Prajapati. 


3 


They said: "Just as we ourselves are well adorned, well dressed 
and clean, so, venerable Sir, are these two reflections well 
adorned, well dressed and clean." 

Prajapati said: "This is the Self, this is immortal, fearless. This 
is Brahman." 

They both went away satisfied in heart. 


4 


Prajapati saw them going and said: "They are both going away 
without having known and without having realized the Self. 
And whoever of these, whether gods or demons, follow this 
doctrine shall perish." 

Virochana, satisfied in heart, went to the demons and preached 
this doctrine (Upanishad) to them: "The self (i.e. body) alone is 
to be worshipped here on earth, the self (i.e. body) alone is to 
be served. It is only by worshipping the self here and by 
serving the self that one gains both worlds—this and the next." 


5 


Therefore even today they say of one who does not practise 
charity, who has no faith and who does not perform sacrifices: 
"He is verily a demon"; for such is the doctrine of the demons. 
The demons deck the bodies of the dead with garlands and 
perfume, with raiment and with ornaments, for they think that 
thus they will win the world beyond. 


 


Chapter IX — The Shadow Self is Perishable 
1 


But Indra, even before he had reached the gods, saw this 
difficulty: "As this reflection in the water is well adorned when 
the body is well adorned, well dressed when the body is well 
dressed, clean when the body is clean, so this reflection in the 
water will be blind if the body is blind, one—eyed if the body 
is one—eyed, crippled if the body is crippled and will perish if 
the body perishes. 


2 


"I do not see any good in this doctrine." He returned with fuel 
in hand. 

To him Prajapati said: "Well, Indra, you went away with 
Virochana, satisfied in heart; now for what purpose have you 
come back?" 

He (Indra) said: "Venerable Sir, as this reflection in the water is 
well adorned when the body is well adorned, well dressed when 
the body is well dressed, clean when the body is clean, so this 
reflection in the water will be blind if the body is blind, one— 
eyed if the body is one—eyed, crippled if the body is crippled 
and will perish if the body perishes. Therefore I do not see any 
good in this doctrine." 


3 


"So it is Indra," replied Prajapati. "I shall explain the Self to 
you further. Live with me another thirty—two years." 

He lived with Prajapati another thirty—two years. Then 
Prajapati said to Indra: 


Chapter X — The Dream Self 
1—2 


"He who moves about, exalted, in dreams—this is the Self, this 
is immortal, fearless. This is Brahman." 

Then Indra went away satisfied in heart. But even before he had 
reached the gods, he saw this difficulty: "Although this dream 
self is not blind even if the body is blind, nor do its eyes and 
nose run when the eyes and nose of the body run; although this 
self is not affected by the defects of the body, 

"Nor killed when it (the body) is killed, nor one—eyed when it 
is one—eyed—yet they kill it (the dream self), as it were; they 
chase it, as it were. It becomes conscious of pain, as it were; it 
weeps, as it were. I do not see any good in this doctrine." 


 


34 


He returned with fuel in hand. To him Prajapati said: "Well, 
Indra, you went away satisfied in heart; now for what purpose 
have you come back?" 

He (Indra) said: "Venerable Sir, although this dream self is not 
blind even if the body is blind, nor do its eyes and nose run 
when the eyes and nose of the body run; although this self is 
not affected by the defects of the body, 

"Nor killed when it (the body) is killed, nor one—eyed when it 
is one—eyed—yet they kill it (the dream self), as it were; they 
chase it, as it were. It becomes conscious of pain, as it were; it 
weeps, as it were. I do not see any good in this." 

"So it is, Indra," replied Prajapati. "I shall explain the Self 
further to you. Live with me another thirty—two years." 

He lived with Prajapati another thirty—two years. Then 
Prajapati said to Indra: 


Chapter XI — The Self in Dreamless Sleep 
i 


"When a man is asleep, with senses withdrawn and serene and 
sees no dream—that is the Self. This is immortal, fearless. This 
is Brahman." 

Then Indra went away satisfied in heart. But even before he had 
reached the gods, he saw this difficulty: "In truth it (i.e. the self 
in dreamless sleep) does not know itself as 'I am it,' nor these 
other creatures. It has therefore reached in dreamless sleep utter 
annihilation, as it were. I do not see any good in this." 


2 


He returned with fuel in hand. To him Prajapati said: "Well, 
Indra, you went away satisfied in heart; now for what purpose 
have you come back?" 

He (Indra) said: "Venerable Sir, in truth it (.e. the self in 
dreamless sleep) does not know itself as 'I am it,' nor these 
other creatures. It has therefore reached utter annihilation, as it 
were. I do not see any good in this." 


3 


"So it is, Indra," replied Prajapati. "I shall explain the Self 
further to you and nothing else. Live with me another five 
years." 

Indra lived with Prajapati another five years. This made in all 
one hundred and one years. Therefore people say that Indra 
lived with Prajapati as a brahmacharin one hundred and one 


 


years. 
Then Prajapati said to him: 


Chapter XII — The Incorporeal Self 
i 


"O Indra, this body is mortal, always held by death. It is the 
abode of the Self which is immortal and incorporeal. The 
embodied self is the victim of pleasure and pain. So long as one 
is identified with the body, there is no cessation of pleasure and 
pain. But neither pleasure nor pain touches one who is not 
identified with the body. 


2—3 


"The wind is without body; the cloud, lightning and thunder are 
without body. Now, as these, arising from yonder akasa and 
reaching the highest light, appear in their own forms, 

"So does this serene Being, arising from this body and reaching 
the Highest Light, appear in His own form. In that state He is 
the Highest Person. There He moves about, laughing, playing, 
rejoicing—be it with women, chariots, or relatives, never 
thinking of the body into which he was born. 

"As an animal is attached to a cart, so is the prana (i.e. the 
conscious self) attached to the body. 


4 


"When the person in the eye resides in the body, he resides 
where the organ of sight has entered into the akasa (i.e. the 
pupil of the eye); the eye is the instrument of seeing. He who is 
aware of the thought: "Let me smell this,' he is the Self; the 
nose is the instrument of smelling. He who is aware of the 
thought: 'Let me speak,' he is the Self; the tongue is the 
instrument of speaking. He who is aware of the thought: 'Let 
me hear,' he is the Self; the ear is the instrument of hearing. 


5 

"He who is aware of the thought: 'Let me think this,' he is the 
Self; the mind is his divine eye. He, the Self sees all these 
desires in the World of Brahman through the divine eye, the 
mind and rejoices. 


6 


"The gods meditate on that Self. Therefore all worlds belong to 
them and all desires. He who knows that Self and understands 


 


It obtains all worlds and all desires." Thus said Prajapati, yea, 
thus said Prajapati. 


Chapter XIII — A Mantra for Meditation and Repetition 
1 


From the dark I come to the variegated; from the variegated I 
come to the Dark. Shaking off evil as a horse shakes dust from 
its hair, freeing myself from the body as the moon frees itself 
from the mouth of Rahu, I fulfil all ends and obtain the 
uncreated World of Brahman. 


Chapter XIV — The Prayer of a Seeker of Eternal Life 
I 


That which is called the akasa is the revealer of names and 
forms. 

That within which these names and forms exist is, verily, 
Brahman. That is the Immortal; that is the Self. 

Now is stated a mantra: "I come to the assembly, the palace of 
Prajapati. I am the glory of the brahmins, the glory of the kings, 
the glory of the vaisyas. I wish to obtain that glory. I am the 
glory of glories. May I never go to the red and toothless, all— 
devouring, slippery place, yea, may I never go to it." 


Chapter XV — The Attainment of Brahmaloka 
1 


Brahma told this knowledge of the Self to Prajapati (Kasyapa), 
Prajapati to Manu, Manu to mankind. He who has studied the 
Vedas at the house of a teacher, according to the prescribed 
rules, during the time left after the performance of his duties to 
the teacher; he who, after leaving the teacher's house, has 
settled down into a householder's life and continued the study 
of the Vedas in a sacred spot and made others (i.e. his sons and 
disciples) virtuous; he who has withdrawn all the sense— 
organs into the Self; he who has not given pain to any creature 
except as approved by the scriptures—he who conducts himself 
thus, all through his life, reaches the World of Brahman after 
death and does not return, yea, does not return. 


End of Chhandogya Upanishad 
The Peace Chant 


Om. May the different limbs of my body, my tongue, prana, 
eyes, ears and my strength and also all the other sense—organs 


 


be nourished! All, indeed, is Brahman, as is declared in the 
Upanishads. May I never deny Brahman! May Brahman never 
deny me! May there never be denial on my part! May all the 
virtues described in the Upanishads belong to me, who am 
devoted to Atman! Yea, may they all belong to me! 

Om. Peace! Peace! Peace!
